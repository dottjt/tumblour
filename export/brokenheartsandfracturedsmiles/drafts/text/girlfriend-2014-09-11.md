My girlfriend is amazing. She’s sort of like a daisy you keep pent-up alone in a glass jar on the window sill, forever living off hope and filtered sunshine. She used to have an amazing rack, but then she lost a bunch of weight and her breasts now look like a failed comedy duo on methamphetamine; desperate and delusional. I feel like I’m being deceived, almost. I mean, how the fuck is a man supposed to snort coke off his girl’s tits if they’re bruised and battered? Well, you just don’t. You give her a hug and a fake phone number; that’s what we call sympathy.

I’m just joking, I really do love her to pieces. She’s beautiful. She’s smart. She has the most gorgeous persian eyes and I love a pretty blush more than the word can pronounce itself. Irregardless, I love her unconditionally and she’s simply amazing. 

However if you stare into the distance you can see the words « slut shame » flash before your very eyes, consuming your surrounding conception into a pitfall of dodgy miasma. Though morbid in all it’s extremity, I’d like to think that it’s a fantasy worth pursuing. 

I stand up. 

I grab her fucking garden salad and smash it onto the ground. I’m not asshole, I’m her boyfriend. Gee, I guess it is a vicious cycle, huh?

I’m really glad that we get to be a tumblr couple. It’s always been a dream for me to have a tumblr girlfriend. The problem is that she’s not particularly flashy and it honestly disappoints me that she refuses to post her breasts online and lead on other boys. She deserves all the dick pics in the world. 

The other thing is that it also means I personally get to talk about all the sex we’re having and that’s a huge point of contention for me. I’ve always wanted to brag about being in a relationship, rather than be that insecure guy who gets really emotionally upset when others talk about all the sex THEY’RE having.

Seriously, I’m going to cry.

We have the best sex. I mean, it’s not the best sex in the WHOLE entire world, however it’s MUCH BETTER than the sex YOU’RE having. In fact, the sex we have is so good, that it makes you feel entirely insecure about who you are and it makes you want to be more like me. I mean, how else to do are you supposed to have sex nowadays!? 

Put it this way, I went through 20+ years of zero sex, zero women, zero anything and I’ll be fucked if I don’t stake my claim ^_^
