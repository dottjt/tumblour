I would like to announce that I’m a happy person and that it brings me no shame to deliver this message. I have been happy long enough now to understand that depression is a horrible mindset that I have no intentions of returning to. 

As someone who used to be highly depressed and insecure, I would like to apologise for my complete selfishness towards society, as well as my attitudes and behaviours over the past few years and/or decades. I apologise for glorifying my condition in the attempt of gaining my self-worth, potentially misleading people as to the true nature of how I feel about myself. 

I no longer feel that depression is something cool or should ever be aspired to, not matter how I’ve sold it as. I believe it has no noble traits, even if it’s consequences may seem “fine and dandy” on the surface of things.
