I had a huge fight with mum and it has really dampened my mood. She’s a solid bitch if I ever saw one. I don’t feel welcome in the house I live in, she only ever has criticism to offer me and her attitude towards my girlfriend is despicable. Quite frankly, I am not worth her abusive attitude and I feel ashamed that she’s my mother. 

But no. This is a game of strategy and I will not falter. I already have the age advantage. I’m young, she’s old. She knows she owns all the assets and she doesn’t realise how important I truly am to her life. When she gets old, she’ll have no one to look after her. She can’t release

She is horribly 

I’m going to meditate and calm myself down. 

I’m going to continue with what I planned today. 

I’m going to learn and live my life. 

I’m going to start a full-time job by the beginning of next year. 

I’m going to move out of home and no longer give her the privilege of being my mother. 

That’s the plan.
