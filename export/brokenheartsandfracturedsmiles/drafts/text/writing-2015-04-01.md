I guess I’m not in the best headspace and for the first time in a while, all my ambition has just sort of dropped off. I think it’s because I am talking with my ex, but at the same time, I feel like it’s something that I want to get comfortable with, rather than perpetually fear and feel weird about for the rest of my life. 

I have this really obscure insecurity about not being a female sex worker. I think I get caught up in the whole privilege aspect of being able to use your body for money, which I think is wonderful. It’s just I don’t exactly have fabulous breasts, nor am I a woman. 

It’s just a matter of perspective, really. 

I realise that I have a lot of talents that female sex workers may not have. I know how to make people laugh and feel good about themselves without having to make them orgasm. 

I always seem to take things really personally. Whenever I see anyone play any sort of musical instrument I just get really inspired to play it. My mind is always all over the place.
