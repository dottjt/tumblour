It’s not every day that you get to murder someone. Not just murder, but conveniently slaughter in broad day, as if the consequence of their life was a meager smudge on the blood slashed across my forehead. I dug a shovel into his throat and twisted the bloody thing till his arms let go of my leg. It wasn’t a fun game of twister.
