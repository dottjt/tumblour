I guess I’m feeling a little depressed, though it’s a feeling of pessimism more than anything.

I feel like I forget what’s important to me. and there’s so much that I want to achieve it’s so… frustrating. I want to relax.

I’m currently in the motel room and my girlfriend orgasmed so hard that she started crying.
