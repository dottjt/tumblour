I’m not saying that was the best sex I’ve ever had, but it was by far, the best sex I’ve ever had.

I feel like sex is a hit and miss situation. Either it feels forced or you’re not really in the mood or you’re in the mood but you exhaust yourself too quickly or… I don’t know.

It was the kind of sex without intention. It was slow, but steady. It wasn’t rushed. It wasn’t particularly overwhelming. It was the perfect climax. Very sensitive. Like a fine wine.
