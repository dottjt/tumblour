I guess there’s this joke of tension between myself and my girlfriend in regards to the people I message over tumblr. She often becomes jealous and afraid. She’s afraid that I’ll leave her for another girl, which has happened to her many times in the past over tumblr. 

Well bae. I want to let you know that you are the most wonderful, special, amazing girl in the whole entire world and that I would never cheat on you or leave you for another girl
