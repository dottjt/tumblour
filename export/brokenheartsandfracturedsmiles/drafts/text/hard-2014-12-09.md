I’m really beginning to think XXXX is actually a sick pleasure of yours. If it wasn’t her it would be something else. Maybe it’s because she made you feel emotions you didn’t know you had (sounds like the type of girl that would spike a broad spectrum of emotions and confusion) So you'know. She would make you feel pretty damn alive. NOT only that but she has denied you closure, still such a mystery, though I would bet that shes just a ‘shell’ who goes with the flow and nothing more. I mean makes sense considering how dead she is inside. Obsession number 3 would be trying to fix the broken, impossible completely fucked tragedy that this girl is. BUT THATS JUST IT. Thats her identity, thats all she is by this point she cant change because a major part of that identity revolves around her being a dead girl with no resilience or drive. Just a shell that gets blown around and taken with the tide. 

That must be hard for you to comprehend because you are so driven. It may be outside of your experience. Especially since you have been on this quest of eliminating anything within your character that resembles that in order for you to be a success. 

She’s the joker to your batman. 

She’s your biggest contrast.

Thank you Liam.
