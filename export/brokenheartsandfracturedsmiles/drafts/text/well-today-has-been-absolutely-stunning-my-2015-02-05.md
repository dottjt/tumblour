Well, today has been absolutely stunning.

My girlfriend came over and I told her earlier that I wanted to take a break from sex and I thought the whole thing was brilliant. 

My view, I guess, is that when you love someone you have so many feelings towards them that you want to express it to them in every single way. Having sex and orgasming is like taking the easy way out. It’s like you’re happy just to spend a certain amount of time to quickly.

Whereas when you take the time, to just cuddle. 

Easily we probably spend 1 - 2 hours having sex and getting all the affectionate over and done with, as we have done normally. However today we spend the whole day just being cute together.
