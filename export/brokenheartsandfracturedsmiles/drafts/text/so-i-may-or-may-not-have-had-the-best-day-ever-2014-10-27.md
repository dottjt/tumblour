So, I may or may not have had the best day ever with my girlfriend. We went to camberwell market. We bought two typewriters from this guy. one for 40, then another for 35. 

Then I got a decanter for jamesâ€™ birthday. 

We had an amazing korean lunch. We talked about the waitress and how koreans get plastic surgery.
