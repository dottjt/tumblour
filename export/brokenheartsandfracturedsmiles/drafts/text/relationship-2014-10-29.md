I think what made my first relationship so detrimental, wasn’t because of the circumstance (even though it was horrible and yes, is largely responsible) but because of how new, inexperienced and impressionable I was to love. 

I guess it’s a catch 22. On the one hand, it’s sufferable. On the other hand, mimi is the most intricate puzzle the world has ever seen. I’ve basically said, fuck it, I’m not going to think about her anymore, it’s not worth my time - but as time goes along, you’ll have certain revelations appear at the top of your head and you’ll feel one step closer towards solving the mystery. 

It’s because I took it so personally, which is a big no no. I don’t see myself tearing my hair at atlantis. But if money, emotions, love was at stake - wouldn’t anyone?

Sometimes I look at this as an issue of where I’m focusing my attention. I look at it as a logical one. Yet the problem is that people think in terms of a very semantic one. It’s about how it makes them feel, not the logical consequences. This is totally cool.
