I’m easily impressed and quick to judge. It’s an attitude that my mother has drummed into me and it’s something I’ve been trying to fight for a while now. I’m getting a lot better, however I still fall into the trap of insecurities and worthlessness. 

I’m going to stop making assumptions about things I don’t know. I want to live my life with peace and understanding. Not the kind of understanding that drives you insane, but the sort of love that drives you into the stars. 

I want to take it easy. I want to rediscover my passions and most of all, I want to take the time to appreciate my life for what it is. I don’t want to take it for granted. I want to look at my life and be proud of all the things that I’ve learn and accomplished. I think I’m a very fine individual. I think I have a lot of merit. 

There’s nothing wrong with me. I merely need to see things from a different light.
