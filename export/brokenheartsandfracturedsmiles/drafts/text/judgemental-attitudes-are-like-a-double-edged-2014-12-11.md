Judgemental attitudes are like a double-edged sword. The statements themselves give us a sense of power and wisdom, because they make us feel right. It’s impossible to make a false judgement in our minds. The reason why we make judgements in the first place, is because we have this image of ourselves, this identity, which reminds us that we should always be right, no matter what the expense. When we make an incorrect judgement however, we take it personally and we compare ourselves with the ideal in our mind that we should be right. This leads to self-criticism and self-judgement.

As long as we have an image of ourselves of who we are in our mind, we will always let our thoughts sabotage us. We will always learn to take everything personally and give up our power to our thoughts, irregardless if it’s in our best interest. We live our life through negative emotional reactions. 

We become perfectionists who always manage to disappoint ourselves and cynics who increasingly become hateful of the world. Accurate descriptions of reality do not require judgemental attitudes and they give up our own personal power to think clearly and critically. This is because judgements are not driven by our desire for the truth, but by the image of who we think we should be in our minds. We allow our thoughts to limit us with the intention of giving us power. The strive for perfectionism is always going to result in failure and self-criticism.

The reason why judgemental attitudes manage to trap us and grow worse over time, is because the transition of becoming judgemental is very subtle and benign. We don’t have the awareness to realise how they harm us, until things become too late. Even then, some people remain so full of hate and judgemental that they continue to cultivate the pain and suffering until it completely consumes them. This is why learning to accept humility can go a very long way. 

Another reasons why judgements can be harmful is that we cannot make a distinction between our judgements and our thoughts. When we make a judgement such as “Oh wow, that person is really ugly », the thought is neurally reinforced in our minds [The importance of neutrality], much in the same way that thinking about performing a motion, such as throwing a ball, activates the part of the motor cortex associated with that movement. Excessive judgements can lead to OCD and other behaviours. 

Judgements are dangerous because they are self-reinforcing and simple emotions and behaviours such as anger and sadness become distorted to the point of becoming abusive and harmful. We believe it’s the negative emotions that drive us, when really it’s the mindset which traps us into our own negativity. This arises because of the belief that we need to be judgemental to have self-worth. We depend on it for our values. 

Ambitions are fundamental to our passion for life, however judgemental attitudes and inner identities do not serve as direct solutions to cultivating passion. Instead, if we are going to live a life free of self-criticism and self-rejection, then we must focus on changing our emotions by dissolving the images in our mind and changing the core beliefs behind these images. Through awareness of these issues, we can learn to understand how we sabotage ourselves emotionally and intellectually.
