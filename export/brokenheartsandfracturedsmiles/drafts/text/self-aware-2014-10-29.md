I’ve been thinking about self-awareness…. I think a preconception that people have of being self-aware, is that it takes the magic out of being alive. What’s the point of living if everything you do is so meticulously controlled, so precisely understood? 

Put simply, I would call the latter arrogance. Those hot people with the big ego’s, it’s like they’re blinded by circumstance. They don’t necessarily have the ability to step back and take a different view on life. I mean, why would you want to leave the bubble? Of course, thinking about leaving the bubble (the concept) and actually doing it are two very different things, yet comfort is a commodity that is seemingly revered amongst those with too much to “lose”. 

Of course, some people are just naturally happy. What the fuck is with that. 

Don’t do meth children. It could end very poorly.
