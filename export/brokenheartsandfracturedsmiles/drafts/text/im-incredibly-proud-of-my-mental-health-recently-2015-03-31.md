I’m incredibly proud of my mental health recently.

I’ve been going through some rough patches in my life and they just keep coming, but I always get through it and it 

, I haven’t let it consume me or get the better of me. I still get sad and depressed, but I always promise to recalibrate myself and to not surrender into my passive nature. 

It’s funny at work because my team leader complains that I apologise too much on the phones and I agree. 

I know I can just give up and live an average, though comfortable existence, however I know I’m capable of so much more. I want to become the best version of myself because it is an expectation I deserve to take responsibility for. 

I’m absolutely flat out with my life at the moment, but I know it will all be worth it in the end. I will have such a bright and amazing future and I’m willing to put in the effort now to make it a reality.
