When I ultimately think about it, part of the reason why I write for my depression website is because it helps me learn more things about myself and my depression.

I’ve slowly come to realise that depression… is just one side of your personality? 

It doesn’t make a lot of sense when you say that “I suffer from depression” because it gives off the impression that depression is bigger than it really is. The equivalent would be so say that “I experience happiness”.

I do not believe neither the happiness, nor depression is something which can define a person. It is a merely an aspect of who we are.

I had the most horrible dream last night, yet I’m also glad I had it. I very seldom dream, so it’s nice to sort of fantasies. 

I was incredibly tired today and I kept daydreaming. I continually have this fantasy that plays in my head where I completely beat the shit out of my girlfriend’s father.
