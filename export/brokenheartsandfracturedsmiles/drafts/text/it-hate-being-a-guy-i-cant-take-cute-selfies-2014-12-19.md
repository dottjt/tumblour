It hate being a guy. 

- I can't take cute selfies of my body and my face because I’m really hairy and masculine and non-metrosexual looking. I can’t even grow a sexy beard. I just have this pubic like facial hair. 

- I love the idea of becoming a sex worker or a sugar daddy, but it would most likely be homosexual and I’m not into that. 

- It’s sexy for girls to post topless pictures of themselves, but my nipples look grotesque no matter how many different filters I use. 

- Dick pics always lead to certain death and I’m not ready to die, yet. 

- Guys flirting always comes across as perverted and creepy. Hell, I’m pretty sure I’m creepy anyway. 

- I’m not allowed to talk about how great men are because apparently that’s sexist and shows how unequal I am. 

When I think about it, I really don’t like gender. In many ways, I’d really like to be a girl. I remember when I was really young, I used to dress up as a girl and stuff. I just feel I’m incredibly feminine about a lot of things, yet I inherently feel like I’m a man. I guess I’m more ambiguous with my thoughts than anything. I wish I could be both, is what I’m saying.
