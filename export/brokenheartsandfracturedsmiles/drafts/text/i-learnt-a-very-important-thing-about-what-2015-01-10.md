I learnt a very important thing about what holidays mean to me. Personally speaking, I don’t believe a holiday is the equivalent to having a good time with your friends. Naturally, you should ALREADY be having a good time with your friends, irregardless of where you are. 

I’m an introvert. Listen, I like having good times, but I really just want to be alone and to think that I’d be having a relaxing “holiday” by being with my family and friends 24/7… is now seemingly absurd to me. One of the things I love about my girlfriend, is that we’re able to do our own thing and not be engaged all the time. To me, that’s refreshing. It allows me to breathe and be at peace.
