Here’s a basic theory on children I just read. Here’s the basic gist of it.

In early primary school, boys are generally rowdy and inattentive, whereas girls do what they’re told. 

When boys do poorly in tests, teachers usually make remarks like "You weren’t paying attention,“ "You didn’t try hard enough,” “You were being rowdy when I was teaching fractions." These are temporary, specific criticisms which obviously can be corrected due to the very nature of these statements.

On the other hand, women can’t be criticized for the same reasons. They get criticisms like "You’re not very good at arithmetic,” “You always hand in sloppy papers,” “You never check your work.” These explanations are universal, permanent and personal (the opposite to specific, temporary and external). These traits lead to a very pessimistic explanatory style of failure, which often a key indicator of depression and mental illness. 

So yeah, children are impressionable and it’s important to keep criticisms optimistic, so that they don’t develop a sense of helplessness, which they discovered is a learnt trait. It’s all about understanding the subtlety of language.
