I like the idea of learning to accept people and things for what they are, rather than what they should be. 

Then again, maybe I’m just naturally blessed with my girlfriend and the quality of people in my life. 

I have moments where I think she’s incredibly pretty, but other times I’ll be feeling kinda eh about how she looks. I think it mostly comes down to how I choose to embrace her in my mind. 

Perspective is a flimsy fellow. 

Ah.
