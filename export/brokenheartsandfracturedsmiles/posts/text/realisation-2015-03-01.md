I guess I had a very serious realisation last Friday regarding my friends and my current relationship.

It occurred to me that nearly all of the close friends in my life… have been people who I can be completely honest and free with. I can tell them how I feel without arguing or having to fight for my position. 

I think this is the sole reason why I get along so well with my girlfriend. We are able to communicate honestly without taking it too personally. Admittedly our relationship is not perfect and it’s hard not to take things personally when you’re in-love, however it almost feels frictionless like fine ice. 

It’s like we flow and dance like a bunch of falling petals on a Japanese autumn afternoon. 

What makes this sort of relationship difficult though is that it’s very hard (at least for me, as a male) to idolise and attach this ideal of honesty to our emotions and desires. Honesty doesn’t speak in the same way that large breasts do. You can’t sugar coat honesty. 

Honesty is virtue and it’s very difficult to sell the truth as something appealing with flair. It simply is the correct procedure, but it doesn’t play on our emotions with the same intensity and necessity that sex appeal can. 

I guess the other conflict is with who I am or at least who I think I am. Let’s just say that I have elements of submission to my personality. I like that feeling of being helpless, most likely relating to my experiences with depression, so it affects the way I think sometimes.

In actual fact I hate it. 

It’s only because I used to idolise my first relationship and it’s lasted such a deep impression on me, that it’s like I have to fight these ideals in my mind. 

Sometimes I wonder if I need to find a way to fantasise and sugarcoat honesty. 

Then I realised that idolising is the problem. I need to stop creating standards in my mind and that’s part of the reason why I never idolised my girlfriend to begin with, because I don’t want to create her as an image in my mind to compete with.

Of course, that doesn’t mean I’m not trying to fight and dissolve the existing images in my head, so it’s simply going to take time. Idolising her would just make it worse. 

I told my girlfriend all this and we cried, but each time we always come back stronger and more understanding and we had such an amazing and loving and cutie weekend and I’m so happy :)
