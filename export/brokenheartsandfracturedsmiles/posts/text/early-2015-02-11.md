It’s so bad when you’re looking through a stack of papers and you find a piece of poetry you wrote about your first ex claiming how you loved her “immeasurably”. 

I had to wake up really early today and it’s made me feel really eerie. I think I fear growing up. 

Even though it happened so long ago, I still unsure how I feel about my past girlfriends. In a sense, it’s like nothing has changed but our circumstances. Though I had a realisation today. That I’m incredibly lucky to have my girlfriend, even if I can’t see. I thought about how truly sad I would be if we weren’t together. 

Love is such a beautiful thing, however when you’re surrounded by it on a constant basis, we can sometimes forget how it got there in the first place. We begin to believe that it’s a privilege, rather than a right. 

I’m in a sort of down mood, but I just think it’s because I woke up before 6.

I think the biggest issue is assuming that at some point life will give me all the answers and everything will make sense, when it’s only bound to become more confusing. 

Somewhere however, is my faith that things will get better. I don’t know how or why, but without belief, we have nothing.
