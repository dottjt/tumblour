Depression is both the worst and best feeling at the same time. It’s a counter-balance of every extreme emotion at the very same time and in that, the most unstable counter-balance the universe ever conceived. 

Now let us replace the word ‘depression’ with 'life’ and you’ll know exactly what I’m talking about. It’s like trying to express yourself fluently with a dagger in your heart, expecting to make sense of the slow and unconditional death of your existence.

I believe depression is about suitably exhausting all possible meaning in life, while pretending it is actually a creation of meaning. It is artistic survival, simply due to the depravity and necessity involved. 

I don’t know what it is about depression, but I have a very love/hate relationship with it. I think I’ve been quite responsible with my depression over the past few months, to say the least. I probably get reasonably depressed once every two weeks (though I usually have an episode once a week, I think) and it’s almost like a guilty pleasure of sorts.

It’s one of those things that I sort of get out of the way and then 99% of the time, I’m focused and determined on my goals. It’s much better than in the past when I would be motivated for weeks at a time, then depressed for weeks at a time.

Today I got depressed because I spent the weekend with my girlfriend and had such an amazing time (our eight month anniversary) and the moment she left, I sort of sunk into my lonely existence. 

Depression is horrible when it turns into panic/anxiety. It turns you into a really shitty person because of how hopeless it makes you feel. The sort of depression with force and momentum. I think all depressive episodes start out like this. 

However the kind of depression where you feel moderately worthless without the keen drive is quite nice, because it’s like being tipsy, as opposed to completely drunk and disorientated. 

Of course everyone gets there at different points. Some people exacerbate their depression so they give it even more momentum. Quite lucky the momentum died quickly, so it plateaued into that nice sort of dullness. 

Maybe I enjoy depression because it allows me to write beautifully and with purpose. I never intentionally make myself depressed, however I think most depression is a direct result of our own actions and thought patterns. It’s one thing to have something bad happen to us, but to interpret these events in a depressive way is the other 90% which confirms our thoughts and feelings. 

I guess I see depression an entirely different, a more subtle flavour of love. Happiness is a beautiful form of love, yet depression is like… the kind of love that stabs you and kisses you goodnight. It’s brutal and entirely sentimental. 

As you can imagine I’m a horribly sentimental person. I cried three times during the movie trailers at the cinemas today. Yeah. 

It’s funny because I was talking with my girlfriend earlier this night and we came across the point that I’m an emotional hoarder. I don’t obsessively collect things, however I’ve managed to keep every single file that I’ve had on my computer since I was like 15. I even used to record my Skype conversations (I know, it’s fucked). It’s like I want to preserve my life in all it’s entirety. 

I think it’s the sort of journalist mindset that I have. 

It’s like I want to hoard all my memories from the past. I have this obsession of hoarding the past, like I don’t want to lose part of who I used to be. 

Depression is that intense feeling of wanting to rip all your organs out of your body, while also feeling completely terrified at the prospect. I don’t know if you can describe depression as a sort of determination, but it burns into you and guides you like a drunken firefly. 

I guess my immunity towards depression has been growing. It’s only been about an hour and I feel like I can quite easily snap out of this moderately down mood. There’s no momentum to my feelings. It’s calm and at the end of writing this, I’m not really feeling that depressed anymore. Perhaps more exhausted than anything.
