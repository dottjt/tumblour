I love my girlfriend so much. 

I cannot believe how lucky I am to have her. I am so incredibly lucky.

I cannot imagine how sad I would be if she wasn’t in my life. She is my best friend and I don’t think I’ve truly managed to comprehend how significant she is in my life.

She is the only person that I talk to every single day and I spend every weekend with her and she really is the love of my life.

I haven’t even realised these things and so I take it for granted. I am totally ungrateful and a complete idiot.
