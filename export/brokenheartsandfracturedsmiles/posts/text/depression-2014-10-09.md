I’m at a point where I can mostly control my depression and prevent it from affecting me. In fact, the more I understand myself, the sillier sadness seems to me. It’s not that I’m no less vulnerable to depression, as it isn’t something that’s ever “cured”, however it doesn’t mean I’m helpless to how I live my life.

No one is ever helpless when it comes to depression. 

One small thing that I’ve noticed is that I can have the most amazing day and be in the happiest mood, but by the time I wake up the next morning, it’s like it’s all gone and I have to start again. This lead me to discover that what I do within that first hour is crucial to setting the mood for how you’ll feel for the rest of the day. 

It takes a lot of perspective and context to understand depression. Some don’t have the energy. Some don’t have the time. However it’s a necessary part that people overlook. Often, it just confuses people even more and makes them more depressed. Recovery is a dangerous game. 

A large problem that people have with their depression is that they think it gives them a sense of “identity” and that by getting rid of depression, it’s like they’re effectively losing a part of themselves. They think that depression is a fundamental part of who they are. 

I whole heartily disagree.

I still feel like the same person that I was before being sad. In fact, I see depression as only being one side to a persons character. We are happy, we are sad, we are envious, we are crushed, we are anything we want to be. Yet no matter what, we are who we are and our emotional states do not define us - they express us for who we are. 

That’s why I think there’s nothing wrong with depression, as there’s nothing wrong with weed or coffee or affection. It’s all about how you moderate it, which is an aspect that people struggle with. 

Fair enough if you enjoy being depressed, as it’s something I still enjoy (I’m not normal). However if you don’t have the ability to control your depression, it’s basically like having a drug addiction you can’t support. If your so-called “habit” is harming you, then you have issues.
