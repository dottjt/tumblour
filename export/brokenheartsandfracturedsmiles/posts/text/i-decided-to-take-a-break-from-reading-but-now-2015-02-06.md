I decided to take a break from reading, but now I’ve gotten back into it and it’s amazing! I worked so hard all day and I decided that I was going to relax… but then I got bored, so I thought I might read again and boy, fucking love words and learning. 

Clearly I should be hung for promoting educational endeavours. 

Burn down all the schools, pronto.
