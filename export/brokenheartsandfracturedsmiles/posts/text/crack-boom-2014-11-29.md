A plasticine trickles down my forearm like rancid jelly. It ferments and conspires, leaving nothing to the imagination. Normality and brain and cheese and pain. It preys on your desires and melts into your consciousness. It bubbles and creeps inside your infectious blood. 

My pretty darling. It never sleeps.

There’s this sort of fake glass surrounding your perception as a human being. It’s not like real glass, because real glass is somewhat heavy on the soul. It knows where you exist relative to the less curious minds around you. Fake glass is dry and unforgiving. It feels so fake that you don’t even need to question it’s authenticity. Fake glass fades like a poor impression on the mind. It is dangerous. 

Eating. Dying. Sleeping. Talk about a trip down memory lane.
