So I’ve written 19 articles for my depression website, which means I haven’t missed a day and it’s a lot of work. Each around is around 1,000 words and I have to write five each week. By the end of this year I hope to have more than 200. 

I feel so shitty this morning. I feel beyond exhausted and I feel like I just want to get stuff done, but my whole body is just a sludge of physical disappointment.
