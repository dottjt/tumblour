I am honestly struggling to write this post. I have no will to write at all and it’s not because I’m depressed, but it’s like… I just find it really boring and dull? 

I know. 

If you read the blog, you probably know that I’m obsessive with words. However I just can’t bring myself to do it. It’s really depressing that I don’t want to write, but at the same time, it’s like I feel… free? 

Reading as well. I can’t stand reading, it just makes me want to fall asleep. I don’t feel engaged in any way. It’s like I don’t care about learning anymore. I used to feel depressed when I couldn’t read the nearly infinite stack of articles that I used to set myself to get through everyday. 

Now, I could honestly care less. 

I think I just go through phases, really. I need to find other things in my life that I enjoy doing, which are usually intellectual in nature.

I’m really in the mood to draw something or learn a language. I don’t know if it’s a cycle of sorts, but for the past month or so I’ve been nothing but vigorously reading and writing. 

One thing I do love doing now, is playing online Chess while listening to ABC Jazz. It’s just the most brilliant thing ever. 

Anyway, I’ve also started writing articles for my depression website. It’s pretty cool, I guess.
