Currently sitting at my desk while I dissect the French version of The Little Prince, listening to ABC Jazz. Mondays are great. 

Unfortunately, my phone has also died and so it looks like I’ll be entering the cave of shame, to the sweet sounds of Lew Tabackin.

Thankfully I have enough cash in my bank account to keep the grammar flowing.
