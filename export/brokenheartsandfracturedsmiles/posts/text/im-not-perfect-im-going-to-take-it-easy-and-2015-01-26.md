I’m not perfect.

I’m going to take it easy and slowly rebuild my confidence. 

You know, it sucks being me. It’s the most horribly, profound experience anyone could endure. There’s something that’s sickly wrong with me and judging by the way I write and the volume at which it compels me, clearly my wiring wasn’t set up for optimal functionality.

So.

Allow me to introduce myself.

Words. Words. Words.

Actually, here’s what I’m going to do. This blog is great n’ all, but it’s rather dainty for my purposes. I need to create… a sort of journal that explains exactly everything that I need to know about myself. 

It’s late. I’m sleeping.
