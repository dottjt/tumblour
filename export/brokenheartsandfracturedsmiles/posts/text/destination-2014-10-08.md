So like, I write a lot, just not on tumblr. 

I find the Notes application on my Macbook to be much more viable. I think the problem with tumblr is that it becomes this sort of obligation to perform and entertain, when really, the whole purpose of words is to express how you feel and organise the thoughts within your head. Sometimes it’s not pretty. Most times it’s barely even legible. 

I’m really happy with the way my life is going. I’m so incredibly grateful for my girlfriend and she’s the most wonderful human being I’ve ever met. In the past 3 months, I’ve learnt more about myself than I have within an entire lifetime. The importance of having an honest dialogue with yourself is almost second to none and it’s as if humans themselves are completely blind to the person standing in front of the mirror. Whereas with a partner, it’s like they observe you in your rawest form and they know you even better than you do. 

It’s a long road, but thankfully, I feel like I’m closer and closer to my destination everyday.
