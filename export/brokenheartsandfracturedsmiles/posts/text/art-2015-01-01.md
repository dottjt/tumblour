I’m really getting into art. 

I bought *new* art academy for my 3DS (I actually snagged 3 copies, since they were going for five bucks each) and it’s the best fucking thing ever. It teaches you how to draw using oil paints, that water colour shit (I think) and pencils and it’s great! I’m also reading books and following tutorials n’ stuff on technique.

Well, it’s just that my mum is a professional artist, and I have a vague talent of drawing, but I guess my mum’s art has never inspired me. She always produces very abstract things, when I’m really into impressionism. 

The best thing however, is that I literally have an entire wall of fancy art books and magazines in my house, so there’s plenty of material to draw on, surely. My mum teaches art classes, but I don’t think I could get her to teach me, even though she’s super talented. 

We simply don’t get along that well and yeah. Sad.
