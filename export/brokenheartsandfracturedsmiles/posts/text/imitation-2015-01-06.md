I’m not sure how I feel today. 

I guess I feel empowered, but it’s not a pleasant sort of empowerment. I feel like I’ve been put on a pedestal for the whole world to laugh at. I almost feel traumatised. I find life in general, rather traumatic, however today isn’t a good day for me.

I just read this book about this guy who got cancer. It made me very teary. I’ve come to realise that I’m very impressionable to a lot of different things. I’m as easily excited as I’m depressed. I watched the imitation game the other day at the movies and I found it very inspiring, but I also cried a lot. 

I’m very gullible as a person, which is why I’m consistently obsessed with the truth; specifically knowledge of the truth. I know that I’m easily swept away by my emotions,

I think I feel lonely because I miss a lot of aspects in my life. I feel like I’m living my life to the fullest, but I also feel incredibly weak. I feel almost worthless as a human being. 

I’m in that mood to just sit there and stare at the wall. 

I couldn’t possibly handle the excitement of living.
