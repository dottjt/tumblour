I feel so much calmer.

I went to meditate, but considering my physical state I ended up dozing off and it felt serene. 

Okay, I’m feeling adult now. I see no point in being a brat. I’m going to start eating and living healthily now. I’m going to beat this flu in the face. 

I asked my boss to take tomorrow off and so that will give me the opportunity to recuperate. 

For tonight, I’m just going to take it easy and not stress. 

I’m going to write my depression articles and then learn some French. Maybe I should watch a movie, but I don’t know many movies :3 

I’m feeling emotionally desensitised, but that’s just part of the fun.

WW3 is over. It’s now time to rebuild.
