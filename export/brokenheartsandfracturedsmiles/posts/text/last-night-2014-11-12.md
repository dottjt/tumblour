Last night was the kick in the bum I needed. At work, a snazzy few hours early, I was talking with a “colleague” (pretty rich, considering I work in retail) and he said he was studying surveying at university.

I honestly had no idea what he was talking about and I still barely do. 

So he’s standing there with his great big grin, talking about the perks of the career, the money, the job security and, all these alarm bells are ringing in my head. “Chase the notion Reade. Fucking do it. You’ll be a superstar with enough drugs to get the kids in motion too. Churn like a fucking a cog on the brink. Churn with me pleeeeeeaaase.”

I could'a punched a wall and gotten away with it. 

Instead of actually working, or as my superiors would call it “being below competent”, I’d decided to spend the entirety of my shift researching potential job careers over the internet. Man, if I had to get a real job job* I would certainly become a surveyor. There’s a critical shortage and it’s only going to get worse. 70% of surveyors are over the age of 55. Wages are literally going to double themselves over the next ten years. 

Au contraire however, I think I’m going to pursue my career as a writer instead. My gosh, the kids are going to hate me. 

It was and still is a difficult decision for me, if not because I’m merely indecisive. It’s something I’m going to pursue for the time being. Ultimately, it’s the sense of risk that gets you and when you stare diligently at the finer details, you realise that there’s always going to be a risk to everything you do. However, I don’t think that’s the best way to look at thing. 

I’d much rather focus on the potential, than the limitations. I should’ve learned twice from my depression. 

Never has risk dawned upon the face of man without a sullen tear in it’s petty eye, as a dowse the remaining of my cigarette into that sweet spot which makes thy cry.

Come back to me when I’m 30, you piece of shit degree. By then, of course, university fees will be extraordinary and in vain. Maybe I should study surveying part time?
