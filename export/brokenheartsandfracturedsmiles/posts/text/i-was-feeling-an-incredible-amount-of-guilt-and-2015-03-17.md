I was feeling an incredible amount of guilt and shame this morning, but I dealt with it aaaaaaand now I’m fine-ish/everything still hurts. 

I’m actually feeling quite optimist today. I plan on writing and learning French - the two things in my life that understand who I am, considering that they are a direct reflection of everything that I can be. 

Something clicked last night before I decided to go to bed. I figured that I was going to start taking things seriously and no longer give into my addictions. 

Healthy everything. All the cigarettes I smoke are 90% filter. 

Apparently I can’t take anything seriously, either.
