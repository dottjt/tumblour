It beats like sour grapes. It churns like a thousand frozen rivers, extracting nothing but the cold and unforgiving atmosphere it breathes from within. She sits there alone in a sort of daze, incomprehensible to the beauty she’s all but lost… in her mind. Drapes of vision blur what was once necessary; a waste of galactic energy permeates into the sky. The snow falls and crumbles onto the soul, forever burdening the misery only spring can hope to cremate. 

We choose to love others, because we cannot love ourselves. We become psychopaths and cynics, all for the feeling we greedily hoard as a memoire to the pain we all avariciously want to remember. It shrieks inside you and rips your organs to caste bone, leaving nothing but an ooze of hate onto the undrinkable pallet your children are now left to bare. You lay there in a pile of death, sulking at the limitations of your lonely demeanour. Cultivating. Transpiring. 

« I can’t do this. I can’t do that. I’m fucking dead, you prick. » The crowd cheers and throws another spear into your most vulnerable heart. The break up which destroyed you. The lingering of your existence which hurts even more. You no longer notice the crowd laughing at you, as the distance of your reality grows despairingly in your mind.

Fucking bastard to your pure spirit. Drift away like a broken wind - catch nothing but innocent disease and the false sense of sweetness you cannot possibly hope to distort. 

The hoodie is no match. Your form is delinquent.

You must perish or die.
