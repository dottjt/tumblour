I’m finding life incredibly intense at the moment. 

I’m always busy and learning or working and it seems that each day is a laborious… progression if it were.

I guess it’s because I have so much ambition in my life. Life would be simple if I did nothing but work a d then relax, but it would also lack the intrigue and veracity that I seek.

I want to be proud by the end of this year and really feel like I gave it my all and that I have an incredible future as a writer to look forward to.

Simplicity is brutally deceiving. Without working towards the future you end up creating a lot more problems for yourself. I want to be a writer and I think it will be a brilliant career.

Of course, there is life and that is all was said. The rest died an incredibly arduous death.

I’m incredibly tired and I have another week of work and writing.

Please wish me luck. The grind can be almost unbearable at times.

Persistence is a bastard, cute as he may be.
