…and it’s like, I know it’s creepy as hell, but there’s this curious part within me that thinks it could lead onto something and it literally never does, no matter how many times I try. I think people lack empathy because they’re afraid. Though let’s be honest, most just can’t be bothered. 

I think I’m interested in people who don’t instantly judge and sort of get that I’m being creepy, but that it’s not really who I am, but are comfortable enough to sort of challenge that notion and not feel threatened. It’s a rare quality to have, without it coming across as defensive or aggressive. 

Now just imagine, my girlfriend is basically the female version of me. That’s right. One day we’re going to have kids and there’s absolutely nothing you can do about it. 

I find it even more absurd that my girlfriend is really popular with a lot of people from the local scene and that they all think I’m an absolute asshole, but then they’ll like our selfie photos on instagram without knowing who I am and it’s just… lul. 

Be polite and nod slowly.

Not too slowly though.
