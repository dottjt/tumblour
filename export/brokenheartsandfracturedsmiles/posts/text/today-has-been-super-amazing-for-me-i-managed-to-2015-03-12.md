Today has been super amazing for me.

I managed to get today’s depression article done on the train, which is a miracle considering I usually get it done by late in the night, which is really stressful for me.

I should also have tomorrows article done as well, which is a huge relief. It’s really hard to come up with 1,000+ words a day. Not to mention, it has to be coherent and make sense. 

I made two sales today, which is crazy and it’s something I’ve never done before. This brings my total to three for the week, which means that I’ve hit my KPI for the first time ever! It also means that I get to relax tomorrow and not stress so much, however I believe that I have at least one sale lined up for tomorrow, so I’m really excited.

hehe. 

I’ve been making a lot of progress with my French as well. It’s what I mostly do in my spare time and I’ve just been getting incrementally better each day. 

I basically go on French tumblr blogs and study quotes. 

Life is just cruising smoothly… yay!
