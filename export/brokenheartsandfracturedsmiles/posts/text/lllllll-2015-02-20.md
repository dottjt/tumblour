Oh god, I can’t do this. 

It’s like a billion degrees right now. I still have to write an article for my depression article and I cannot be fucked. 

I have friends coming over and they want to get drunk and I’m really just in the mood to snuggle with my girlfriend and have slow sex with her. I haven’t seen her all week and it’s killing me. 

I’m exhausted as shit from my first week of full-time work and I just want to switch off. I’ve been playing smash bros and that has been helping. 

I’m so incredibly jealous of girls who webcam. Then I realised that I get to prove my self-worth with my voice, rather than with my body and so now I feel like I’m on an even playing field. 

Some of the ladies at work are just vile and I know it sounds horrible, but it’s true. Irregardless, they are some of the most talented sales people I have ever met, with amazing voices and a sense of persuasion that is beyond masterful. It’s something that I admire and honor. 

I would honestly love to webcam, I just don’t have the body or the ethnicity that people want. That’s okay. I have so many other talents that I’m incredibly proud of and which I can hope to inspire others.
