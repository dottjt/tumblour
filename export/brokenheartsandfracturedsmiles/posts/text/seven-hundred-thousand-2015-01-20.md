I’m in a mood of undeniable rejection.

I hate my words, my grammar is laden with stupidity and I feel completely inconsistent with the beauty I fail to construct. Nature is pointing it’s dirty little finger at me and I wish it would stop biting. It snickers at me without care, like a lone stranger with an angry grin. 

The more I write, the more the fragments within me splinter and burst. Sentence structure is a sight of excruciation to my eyes. It looks dumb and broken, like a racist symphony designed to insight fear and weakness. 

This keyboard isn’t congruent with the way I currently feel. I need a gun or a sledgehammer. I want to laugh at the madness within me, as I obliterate all meaning back to the hell it derives.

…

Actually, I’m feeling a lot better now. I decided to go outside and sit on the grass. It’s beautiful outside. I have this large garden in my backyard, full of tall sunflowers, corn, beans, lettuce, you name it. Nature is calming and serene.

Today has been quite intensive when I think about it and I didn’t properly take the chance to leave my room all day. I spent all of my time writing my resume and applying to online job forums. It’s been tiring to say the least.

I guess one of the things I lackey about this blog, is that my posts aren’t as perfect as they could me. I know if I just spend that extra 20 minutes more rewriting, I can turn this sludge of broken dreams into a masterpiece worthy of gods. However, I choose to spend my time elsewhere.

As much as I love art, I do not have the freedom to make it my Oswald. 

It’s reaching that point in the day where I should consider sitting back and relaxing. I haven’t taken a moment to stop all day. I’m a very industrious person and it’s simply not in my nature to cease all activities, which I know to be wildly unhealthy. My mind is constantly switched on, like a razor blade with the intent to kill. I’m always desiring some kind of mental stimulation, be it some kind of knowledge or a small child to devour. 

I’m introverted, folks. Yet, I don’t think that’s necessarily true. The only reason why I like to read books is because it’s like I’m directly communicating with a person’s thoughts in a more intimate and revealing way, rather than if I had the opportunity to talk with them.

Which, I don’t. 

I swear, I’m nothing like these words in real life. I may have a vivid imagination, however that doesn’t mean reality isn’t confined to it’s own misery.
