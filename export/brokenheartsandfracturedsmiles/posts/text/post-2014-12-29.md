Here I am in a sort of “post sex” Queensland. Well actually, it’s on the border of NSW and Queensland, but you can’t complain when there’s a 30 degree heat holding you sideways and a fuck load of semen dripping down like depressed palm trees along your face, keeping our collective sway from tipping over and eating your soul. Don’t let the moisture molest you and procreate inside you. It’s how our old mate Ken died and that bitch Rhonda better go down with the tide as well. 

This really isn’t writing weather, I apologise.

You. Gimme my fucking buffet you whore. Three weeks of kicking the skitter while my brains fry like a sick duckling in multiple burns of fucking pan. It’ll fuck you real good and the neurons you splatter can only ricochet when your shit breaks the bank. 

cutie time overload.
