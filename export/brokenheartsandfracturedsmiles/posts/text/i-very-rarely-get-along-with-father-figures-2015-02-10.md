I very rarely get along with father figures, particularly my girlfriend’s father. 

Having grown up largely without a father, I don’t want someone to father me. I have always been my own role model in life and that is why I am so self-determined as a person. 

The worst thing is when they try to lecture you. I don’t want your lecturing. You wouldn’t lecture another father how to live their life, so please don’t lecture me. 

In general, I always go my own way, perhaps even to my own detriment.
