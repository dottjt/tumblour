On the way to work today I dropped my macbook air onto the concrete and so now there’s this major sort of… since the macbook air is made of metal, the top left corner has crumpled in spectacularly.

This looks incredibly odd since the macbook is supposed to be so stylish and because it’s not made of plastic, there’s this metallic bump that really stands out on the flat surface left of the keyboard.

It looks really ugly, but I think this event is a really good thing. 

It’s teaching me acceptance and to simply accept my macbook for what it is. It is not perfect, however it is a completely superficial aspect of it’s function.

It still works perfectly. It still does everything that I want it to. 

We spend so much time trying to change who we are or lingering on our past regret and wondering what would happen if we simply did things a little differently.

Fuck that. My macbook looks damaged, but it’s still my lil’ baby.
