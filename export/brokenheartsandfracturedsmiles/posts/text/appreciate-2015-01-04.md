I guess the biggest issue I have with my life is that I feel like I take my girlfriend for granted. At times, I feel like I don’t give her enough attention and care, even though we’re always highly intimate in our conversation. A lot of the time when I’m out in public, I’ll obsess over other girls and stare at everyone but her. It feels like being trapped inside a flashy casino, with lights blinding me from every corner. 

It’s not that I don’t love my girlfriend and that I don’t think she’s brilliant. She’s everything to me and I doubt I could find a more amazing partner in a thousand lifetimes, which I would believe to be rather sincere, considering how meticulous I am as a person. It’s just that I'm just so easily distracted by trivial things and in the process, I sometimes forget how significant my “significant other” truly is. 

When I think about it, this issue relates to the way I view women. I guess it’s like, I have a difficult time being friends with women, unless if it’s inherently romantic. I feel like I can only be flirty with women, because that’s all I’m good for. I try my hardest to be friends with girls and it works to an extent, but the problem is that I’m inherently attracted to all the interesting girls I can manage to hold a conversation with, so it’s like, my mind can’t distinguish between the two? 

I’m honestly still not quite sure, but I’m trying. 

It’s not until moments later, when I get to be with my girlfriend and hold her body and experience her love and intimacy on a deeper level, that I’m reminded of how truly blessed I am to have her. She’ll light up my world with a sort of grace that even I can’t quite comprehend. It’s like, I use my wild imagination to our advantage, so that instead of wandering off and thinking about other girls, it’s focusing on our relationship and how special that is. 

I mean, my girlfriend is honestly stunning. I have no idea how I got her, but she is dead pretty. Everything about her face is practically flawless. Her eyes are bright and beautiful, her lips are large and luscious, her rosy cheeks are brimming with love and her cutie nose is impeccable. Blessed doesn’t begin to describe my position. 

Though I guess that’s what life is about - to experience and explore the way the mind and it’s systems conspire. It’s an abundant world we live. The hard part is channeling that energy to produce the life that best suits you.
