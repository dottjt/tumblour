I’m currently learning Japanese because Chinese people aren’t cool and I want to be cool. Actually, my girlfriend is attending Japanese language classes and I have to be alpha as fuck and own her at her own stupid game (HA!), so I can dominate that lil’ puss of hers and make her feel like all inferior and woman like. 

…except for the fact that she used to study it and lived in Japan for an extended, though not limited period of time. Such bad. 

*sigh*
