I had a really stressful day at work today. 

I was constantly threatened and abused by people over the phone. To hear the words “fuck you” shouted at you early in the morning when you are impressionable trying to act confident, is a real killer.

To make things worse, said individual kept calling me over and over again. 

Then this other guy called me and the first thing he said was “I want to talk your manager.” Then he started threatening me with legal action. He must have called back 15 times and I just had to ignore him and keep going.

Then I kept getting all these unknown numbers within a small space of time and I pick up one, and this guy didn’t sound very right and he kept asking odd questions and I think I realised it was that guy trying to sue me and it was so suss and a crumbled when he asked for my name, so I said my name was Peter and then I hung up.

So I was incredibly paranoid all morning, not wanting to pick up any of the calls ringing me back and I felt terrible.

I feel really vulnerable right now. 

I think I’m just going to study French and take tonight easy.
