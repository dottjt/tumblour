I just had the most random thought pop up in my head. 

I remember seeing an old photograph of my father with his ex-girlfriend when I was roughly 8 years old and I’ve now come to realise, even though my memory is faint, that she looked an awful lot like my first ex-girlfriend.

Not to mention, she was from New Zealand as well.
