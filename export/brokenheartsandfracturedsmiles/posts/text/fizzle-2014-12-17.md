I’m dead.

I apologise if I haven’t been getting back to your messages. So, today I registered the domain name for the website, as well as the hosting and I spent all afternoon trying to configure wordpress and learn how everything works and blah, blah, blah. 

My aspiration is to become a freelance writer and I’ve put everything into it. I spend all day reading about how the business works, how to successfully go about it, the skills I need to have, the process of how to market yourself… and I’m absolutely exhausted! 

Read. Read. Read. 

It will all be worth it in the end and I know it’s something I’m going to do really well at. Not to mention, all those future opportunities. I’m so tired. I hate feeling lethargy.

…holy shit, so the company I signed the website hosting with just called me to thank me for choosing their service. +1
