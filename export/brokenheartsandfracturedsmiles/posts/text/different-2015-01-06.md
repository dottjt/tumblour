I guess I sort of feel helpless. I don’t like what this holiday has become. It’s not the sort of holiday experience I’m used to, where I get to travel and just write and read and do my own thing. I’m used to travelling overseas, where the culture is different and the experience is vestigial, but Queensland is this vastly inappropriate and artificial landscape.

I don’t like it’s self-indulgence. It makes me feel weak. Furthermore, I don’t like how my girlfriend’s parents (the people responsible for this trip) dictate everything. I guess they have different ideas of what a holiday is. For them, it’s about the relaxation and the misallocation of schedule. For me, I tend to treat life like one big learning experience, drowned thick with introspection. I don’t want to go to shopping centres and small towns, which are no different to the one’s we have at home. I feel like it’s all so pointless. 

I don’t really have control over what I want to do, I sort of have to stick with the family, and day activities like going to a rural town for no apparent reason other than to leave the caravan, drives me insane.

I basically spend all my time with my girlfriend and her parents and it’s becoming a nightmare for me. I mean, I like spending time with my girlfriend, because I can just sit there and do my thing, but the parents are a bunch of cryptic psychopaths; completely unbearable at times.

For example, the father says that he’s more than happy to pay for everything, but then he bitched behind my back for never offering. If I offer, I get told off and I look like an idiot. If I don’t, I’m still a fool. It’s like, he just wants to know that you’re willing to accept humility, even though it’s completely disingenuous. The list goes on. What a load of crap. 

It’s like, I really don’t care about the fancy dinners. It’s great and all, but I’d rather be learning something and I feel like this holiday gets in the way of that. 

If I don’t get to use my brain, I basically get depressed. The problem is that they take me out to these places, I get sad, but they have no idea what’s wrong, so they start speculating pointlessly. The worst thing is that my girlfriend tries to explain that I’m introverted, but they just don’t get it. 

I basically spend most my time writing or reading books any chance I can. I read my laptop in the car - it’s my only way of coping. I’m really introverted so I pretty much want to spend all of my time alone, if possible. Of course, constantly being around her parents is just killing me and so I have to escape, but there are times when I have no choice but to be with them, so that’s when I get sad and feel helpless. 

Please love me.
