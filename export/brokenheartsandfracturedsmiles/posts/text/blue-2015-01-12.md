Blue rectangles. Aluminium disappointment. Racks of shelves upon wooden disaster; the eyes of it’s pages form hostile unions amongst the harsh fray. A bunch of homely cowards, the lot of you. I slowly tilt my hand towards the exterior, leaning my face into the bellow of the high corn wheeze. 

I lick the glass with ease. The friction of my saliva drips and swerves without an inch of haste to hurry it along the path of least resistance. Metallic tears of sunder rear it’s ugly head, burning it’s worry into the etch of it’s past.

A sharp knife gapes for opportunity around the curving bend. Tip. Toe. Smack. Oxygen rises and forms it’s enemy. Ginny is a pretty name, like a cracker with a dead parrot to it’s name.

Too bad it doesn’t mask the smell. A very hideous smell. The thoughts are conspiring and the ugly mask is failing to find it’s prized face. 

Buffet.
