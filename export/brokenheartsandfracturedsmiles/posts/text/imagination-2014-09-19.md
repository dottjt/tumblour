There’s a sort of wallow in my life today which inexplicably refuses to show it’s hand. I’m currently staring at the TV screen like a mindless zombie and even though the TV thus isn’t turned on, the screen itself represents a sort of hollow reflection of the static and meaningless nature we’ve all come to know and love. Of course, pessimism is so much more than an abusive husband or a dodgy lover and we’re all obsessed with the idea of being dark and brooding, if not to convince other people that we’re worthy of being fucked.

It’s kinda hot, wouldn’t you say? 

Imagination is my fatal coping mechanism. I don’t like it when my mind is only limited to R-E-A-L-I-T-Y. I’m much too curious and want nothing less than my own sense of suffocation and brooding desire, trickling anxious down my stream of moody agitations and unworthy happenings. I’m constantly eye-fucking strangers in public, but only the hot ones. Quite unfortunate, so they tell me. I really do believe it’s in my best intentions to fuck anyone, or anything, that has a mouth and two legs.

Delicious.

I want to fuck her body. I want to fuck her vision. I want to fuck her thoughts. I want to fuck her sense of hearing, as I force her intelligence down to the very vibrations fucking her back.

I imagine myself sitting in her lap, slowly caressing her hair into a false sense of comfort, as she shakes and trembles to the dagger held firmly to her throat. She breaks down into a slurry of moping and tears, diligently watching her dead mother twitch on the floor to the misery her mother’s chest wounds she so forgivingly deserves. All she’d ever wanted was for her nice little daughter to grow up with a 1st world education and pair of breasts that spoke widely of her visual talent.

Yet that’s simply not what this situation can and will demand. I cut her throat and grab her breast. Ah, it just wasn’t worth the effort. 

I don’t think I’ve ever fantasized about men, because men freak me out, as I’m sure you’re more than aware of. Not that you can’t explore inside another man’s shaft. I’ve just never realised human ingenuity could ever be so sexually disingenuous. 

Behold, your insanity. Man, I really do wish I was bisexual. That would be grand; another 50% of the population to pervert and aggrandise. 

Sobriety is fatal.
