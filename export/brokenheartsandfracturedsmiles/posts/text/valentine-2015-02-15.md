It has been such an incredible weekend. 

The sort of experience that words cannot warrant. I have all the memories and photos that I will ever need and there’s this feeling inside me that simply does not want to escape. 

I am so grateful for the life I have. At 22 years of age, I feel like I have so much ahead of me and I know that 2015 will be a most spectacular year. 

Tomorrow I start my first full-time job and I hope it’s something that will allow me to succeed. I’m slowly beginning to feel like an adult and while the prospect terrifies me, it also gives me hope. 

I’m going to get a car. I’m going to get my license. I’m going to move out of home. I’m going to slowly build my career and I’m going to have so many more amazing experiences with all the people I love. 

I think it’s important to note that I don’t think anything can ever prepare you in life, whether you’re 10 years old or 80. Your mental health, your relationships, your circumstances, your education - no one really knows what the hell they’re doing and we all hope each and every day, that our answers will somehow appear before us and makes things that-much-easier; answers that never come as they never existed in the first place, to all the pointless questions we ask ourselves everyday. 

I believe it’s those who embrace these vulnerabilities that end up feeling the happiest and most fulfilled. We are all vulnerable and we are proud.
