I think it’s interesting to note how people respond when you greet them with a simple ‘hi’ over tumblr. 

Some people take it like you’re threatening them with a switch blade. They become really aggressive and defensive. 

Others are really curious and actually take the time to respond with something interesting. 

Quite a lot of people just aren’t motivated to share their life. Very few people are willing to have an intimate conversation over the internet, but that’s not an issue. You just find people worth talking to and who are interested. 

Most don’t respond to my follow up message. 

This one girl suggested we meet up a few messages in and she’s really cool. 

Man, I can’t wait for the weekend because I get to see two of my old friends who I haven’t seen in a while. We’ve talked about getting an apartment together and think it would be quite swell.
