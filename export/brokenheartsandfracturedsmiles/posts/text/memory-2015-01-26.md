I just made myself the dankest coffee. I doubt I’ll survive beyond a few sips.

I’m writing this post today to give my girlfriend the due credit that she deserves. She is such a stunning human being, that merely thinking about her paralyses me. Of course, it could also be that I’m feeling incredibly vulnerable right now.

I was in an incredibly bad place last night. It was the sort of depression that convinces you to give up entirely. You allow the depression to wallow inside you, giving only hope to time to heal your wounds. You become so violated and so demoralised of who you are, that not even a shred of hope seems available to you for consumption. You let it infect you down to your very soul, as the hollow grows deeper into an array of dark, consummate practices. 

In a sense, people do what they’re least capable of, because that’s what their insecurity begets. I shouldn’t be a writer, yet that makes me a perfect candidate for writing. I’m a bundle of severe imperfections that give grammar the life and character it needs to shine. 

I have a horrible memory for facts. To be perfectly honest, I have very little memory at all. The upshot essentially is that instead of remembering the words on this screen, it’s taught me to improvise with my grammar which is why I’m incredible at constructing prose. 

I can barely remember yesterday, let alone one week ago. My mind doesn’t have that sort of capacity. It personally hurts to know that my past is a vague blur. I have no memory of all the time that I’ve spent with my girlfriend or my friends. 

My girlfriend knows me better than anyone else and I often discount how intelligent she is. I guess I feel bad because I’m such a temperamental person. I’m both the most amazing and most horrible person in the world. I have to improvise everything to the point that I don’t even know who I am as a person and that takes it’s toll eventually. 

She says it’s because of my drive as a person. I’m so focused and I try so hard, that inevitably I crash and burn. I don’t know what I can do. 

My ex-girlfriend reactivated her Facebook account a few days ago and it’s been a bit of a trigger for me. I think it’s because of this idea of vicinity. It’s like, she’s somehow closer to me and I guess, all the associated assumptions tied to that notion. I can’t stop refreshing her facebook page.

I guess I’m really angry because of my fucking memory. I’ve dealt with this OCD issue in the past, many many times before, but I can’t remember the reasoning of why it was such as a stupid thing to worry about. 

It’s like, I have to keep improvising these fucking epiphanies to try and catch up with the way I feel from the past and I honestly feel like crying. I think that’s part of the reason why I focus so much of my time doing intellectual things like reading, writing, learning things etc. 

I’m trying to improve my mind so that I don’t have anymore of these bad feelings, but then something insignificant happens which renders me useless and I just feel fucking incapable. 

I feel like I only remember the emotions from my past and particularly, I’m prone to remembering the things that were the most traumatic and my past relationship still affects me till this day. It’s like, everything I relate to in my life revolves around my first relationship, simply because of how significant it was and it’s almost like, everything I am today is because of that one event. 

It was the moment I first learnt to love and experience love. It’s what I keep coming back to and because it was such a horrible experience for me, it’s completely skewed everything I’m suppose to know. Because of my poor memory, it’s like I rely on those emotions for me to relate to the world, yet they’re emotions of pain and sadness. 

It’s impossible to fight the past, so sometimes you just embrace the vulnerability, hoping that it will give you the answers that you need to simply be free, when it’s the exact opposite. When you become so confused about life, you sometimes just revert back to the past for answers and my past is ridden with pain. 

I hate myself and I’m crying. 

When I come to think about it, my girlfriend is my memory of sorts. She remembers everything about our relationship and my shortcomings. I don’t know what I’d do without her, and she’s so supportive of me and I can’t believe she loves me. I’m not worth it and I can’t believe how stupid I am :(

I’ve finished my coffee and my mouth tastes like rabies.
