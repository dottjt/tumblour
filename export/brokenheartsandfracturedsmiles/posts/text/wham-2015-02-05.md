Okay. 

I guess I had a bit of an epiphany today, as I do most days. 

While I am a failure in many respects, I am also a quick learner and by gosh, I learn quick. 

I realised that I no longer want to take my life for granted. 

Well, yeah. 

I am going to find a job. I am going to start writing my cover letters and resumes differently. Clearly my current approach is not working out and I need to find a different way to sell myself. 

I am going to write my articles. I am going to promote my depression website. I am already doing these things magnificently. 

I know I have it in me to succeed and it is going to require putting in effort, while feeling inspired by the whole process. I have decided to stop orgasming, as I originally intended. I am eating super healthy. I am sleeping well for the first time in months. I have stopped all caffeine. 

I really want this more than anything. 

Most importantly, I have stopped using abbreviations in my writing which makes me come across as super serious and lame. I promise I am still fun and loving, as I stare into your eyes and caress your soul.

Now it’s just weird. Sorry!
