I don’t know if we’re truly living our lives or seemingly running away from it. 

It feels like I’m simply existing to fulfill these activities, rather than because they have any inherent purpose. 

I think it’s almost funny, because I acknowledge that it’s my emotions that are making me feel like this and I also think that I’m trying my best to not take them personally.

That’s really the biggest downfall of people who get depressed. They take their conditional personally, when really it’s a facet of who we are.

The French continues!
