I remember when I used to be cool. When words shattered like popsicles of purified hatred upon the most delicate of nerves, calculating spines into the most delicious fields of ripe madness. 

When dilapidation projected billions of cool aspirations into a world of triangular paralysis, spiralling hate and regret into monotony, as our haze of tropical dystopia overcomes the senses and burns through our soul. 

I pointed a gun to her head and screamed. I was unsure who screamed first, however the barrel of my gun managed to explode out of my hands and onto the exterior of the floor, as the silver-laced bullet whirled through her skull and splattered what was left of our confrontation.

â€¦tears forming enemies against the tyranny of our forebode. 

I remember when teenagers represented symbols of pornographic angst against the high definition backdrop of our hopeless lives. It is all lost now, because of that fucking bitch sully. 

I promised she would not sleep tonight. 

The End. 

eh, words are lame. I needed the imagination to run free for a bit. I should get back to writing articles for my depression website.
