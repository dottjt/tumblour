I’m so glad that I’ve adopted this attitude of not taking my emotions personally, because today I feel amazing! 

I have a job interview in about 2 hours, which I already know I’m going to ace, which means I should have a full-time job starting Monday paying $25 an hour (that’s like a grand a week folks and I’ve been unemployed since November, so I’m stoked to finally have an income).

Which means I can finally afford a car, get my license and then move out of home! 

I then have radio afterwards and the sun is shining and nothing can stop me! I want to write so many articles today and learn so much French and just explode into everyone’s faces! 

Yep. I’m as neurotic as they come, but listen, the alternative last night was that I being a cycle of being super depressed for weeks/months at a time, while I binge on drugs and unhealthy lifestyles. 

So using perspective/logic to deal with my woes, is an almost godly way of preventing future emotional pain. I truly believe my depression website is a valuable asset.
