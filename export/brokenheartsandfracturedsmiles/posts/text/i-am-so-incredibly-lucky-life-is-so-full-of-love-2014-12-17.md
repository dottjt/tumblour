I am so incredibly lucky. Life is so full of love and opportunity. I never want to take my life for granted again, however I know that I will and the coming tragedy will be as devastating as it will be predictable. 

I wholeheartedly respect nature. I don’t ever wish to provoke my own stupidity, but sometimes humans learn best when they’re half-beaten on the ground, begging for mercy. 

Spit once and die twice. I like those odds.
