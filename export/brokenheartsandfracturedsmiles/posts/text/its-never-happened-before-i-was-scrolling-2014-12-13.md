It’s never happened before. 

I was scrolling through my tumblr feed and I stumbled across this post detailing the kinds of abuse that women in the porn industry suffer and it’s just… I guess it really opened my eyes up to the kinds of horrors that people have to endure. I usually turn a blind eye to this kind of thing or more commonly, it simply doesn’t phase me, but reading it almost made me feel ill. 

I guess it’s because I used to be chronically addicted to pornography. I would sift through 20 - 30 videos in one sitting and just roll the eye-candy through the inner extent that my own depravity would allow. I’ve been back to that dark place many times, though nothing worth doing in life is ever easy or simple. 

Of course, that’s a very self-centred view to take. Not all porn stars are abused and not all porn consumers are addicted - though likely a large proportion of people in both demographics are those things. 

In other news, I made my girlfriend cum 6 times today.
