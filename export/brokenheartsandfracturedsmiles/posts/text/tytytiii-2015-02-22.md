My eyes feel horrible. They feel like fallen angels. 

Today is going to be a long and arduous journey, like some kind of bullshit hike into a raging black hole, however I have a vision of where I want to be and I know it will all be worth it in the end.

I want to be at a point by the end of this year, where I can physically rip your eyeballs out while apologising and getting away with it at the same time. That’s how good I’m going to be and I’m going to make so much money.

I think it’s sad that writing has sort of… lost meaning to me. It’s like I don’t like to write anymore, but I also feel like it’s run it’s course. I feel like I don’t have anything to gain from writing anymore. However old habits come back quick and I’ve found new love in persuasion.

I want to focus my efforts on tonality and NLP. I want to be able to do accents and… life ain’t over yet. I have a lot that I still want to achieve and it’s an excitement that brews inside me.
