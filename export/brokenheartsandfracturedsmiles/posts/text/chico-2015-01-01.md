So like, there’s this Spanish girl at the caravan park and she’s very sweet and we smile at each other and stuff. I keep seeing her in the play room and we’re both desperate for wifi. 

I’m going to have to introduce myself at some point. The sexual tension between us is killing me. Just before, she was in the room with her younger brother and her mother, then they all left and moments later, she returned and decided to sit next to me on the couch, while tinkering on her phone. 

Imagine steamy hot Queensland sex, while I finger her in the pool. I don’t know though, I feel like it’d be disingenuous of me. I’ll approach one of these days. 

Obviously I have a girlfriend already /sarc

PS: Fuck, a kid just tripped over my penny board and then I had to say “Sorry mate” and now she knows what my voice sounds like aaaaaaaand there goes my mystery and appeal. Better luck next time Reade.
