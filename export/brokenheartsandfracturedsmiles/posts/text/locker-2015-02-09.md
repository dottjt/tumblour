I’m quite meticulous with who I am. 

I love experimenting with my body and my mind and experiencing reality from different extremes. I think that’s partly what drew me to depression, the desire to explore delusion. I have this attitude that I can get over any hurdle, even if it seems like a confusing mess - hence my fascination with acid. 

I’ve managed to train myself to eating only one meal a day. It’s not even an excessive portion, it’s simply one normal serving of food. I get minor hunger pangs for a few moments, but then it goes away and I feel more clear-headed throughout the day. 

haha and the cheapness in me knows that I’m saving money on food as well. Listen, I’m the dickhead who rocks up to the State Library with a shopping bag, so that I can scrunch it up outside, put it in my pocket and carry all of my things so that I won’t have to worry about paying the $2 locker storage fee. 

I will happily buy less, so that I can work less and do more of the things that I love. I think that’s a very reasonable conclusion. 

Of course, it doesn’t explain why I blew $300 in January so I could shoot handguns for an hour. One of the bullet casings flung off and hit my forearm and it still hasn’t properly healed. Either that or it’s the scar.
