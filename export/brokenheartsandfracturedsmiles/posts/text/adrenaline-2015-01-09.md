I just got back from Wet n’ Wild World and I think I’m experiencing vertigo. Everything seems off centre. I’ll be honest, I have no idea what vertigo is, but it sounds appropriate for what I’m feeling.

Exhausted. Adrenaline. I scream like a girl. 

I guess I feel terrified on the inside, but now that I’m back at the caravan park, I feel oddly hollow. My best mate flew down from Melbourne so he could join me for a week (as my birthday is in four days) and that was really nice of him. We had an amazing time at the theme park, but it’s Movie world and Sea world tomorrow!

I’m sorry, but I just couldn’t take my eyes off all those pretty women wearing scantily clad swimsuits and bikinis. Slender bodies and large breasts. I mean, how do you not look away? There was this one girl, who literally had perfect everything and I think I nearly drooled.

I can’t help it and even my girlfriend was like, yeah, I don’t blame ya. To be fair though, there were so many hot guys for my girlfriend to prey her delicious eyes upon. 

Seriously though, my head doesn’t feel right. My sense of space and time is all over the place.
