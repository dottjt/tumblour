I was talking to my girlfriend about weed and she’s incredibly straight edge and I suggested that we smoke some joints when we go on our picnic, but she was worried about smoking weed in public. 

Then I remembered that one time me and my friend Jack were in the city and we were desperate to find a place to smoke bongs and so we broke into an RMIT lecture theatre and did it there. 

Then I remembered that one time we were at Minotaur in the city and I stole a book and the beeper went off and we ran and we were paranoid for the rest of the day haha. 

It’s just Chess and Jazz for me now, thank you very much.
