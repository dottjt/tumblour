So my girlfriend’s parents absolutely despise me and I’m in her car which is parked in the driveway od her house. It’s incredibly tense.

They don’t know I’m here and there’s even a chance she won’t be allowed to come out.

I haven’t been back to her house in months. Her parents are heinous in their abuse.

I’m hoping her father doesn’t drag me out of the car and beat me.
