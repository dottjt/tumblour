I guess when I think about it, what I’m saying is that I feel like I’m in-control of everything. I don’t feel weak or helpless or necessarily disadvantaged. I feel like I’m capable of whatever my heart desires and that even if things may seem difficult, that there’s always a process and method to getting to where you want to.

There’s a great quote I read from a book recently on self-esteem:

“There’s a lot of talk these days about giving children self-esteem. It’s not something you can give; it’s something they have to build. Coach Graham worked in a no-coddling zone. Self-esteem? He knew there was really only one way to teach kids how to develop it: You give them something they can’t do, they work hard until they find they can do it, and you just keep repeating the process.” 

Start small and eventually you’ll get to where you want to. Everyday, I’ve been aiming to eat really healthy and I work out most days and it’s been great. I’m trying to cut fat, so whenever I eat a meal now, I’ll obviously eat healthy things, but I’ll go a step further and leave a bit of food on my plate, so I’m eating less.

We don’t have to be helpless. I know trauma would suggest otherwise, but that’s part of the challenge. 

Convincing yourself of the true potential of reality.
