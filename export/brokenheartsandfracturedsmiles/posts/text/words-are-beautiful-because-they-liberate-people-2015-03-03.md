Words are beautiful because they liberate people. 

They open vast swathes of beauty within our minds, forever culminating into the increasingly complex ideas that we hoard like torn newspaper, until our mass of neurological tease collapses upon itself into a field of arcanine jelly; forever dripping into the dreams of future generations through the stories and lies we whisper ever-so loudly in our sleep.

Splotches of green and purple inject itself into your veins, as if bound for the destiny your reality hints at every single day of every single second of your life. 

Tress and birds, blurs and stitches, your legs evolve and assimilate into the floor.
