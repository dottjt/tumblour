I feel really sad right now, like I’m a worthless failure. 

I think it’s because I had a really shitty day at work and it’s reminded me that I’m not where I want to be in life. I really hated my job today and then I realised I’m not the successful journalist that I always imagined I would be. 

I feel like no one really cares about who I am or what I write or what I think. God knows what that’s even the goal that I’ve setup in my mind. 

I know these feelings and thoughts are bullshit and I think I’ve just become shortsighted with my vision of who I want to be as a person. 

ugh. 

I don’t fucking know. 

There’s no point in rambling.
