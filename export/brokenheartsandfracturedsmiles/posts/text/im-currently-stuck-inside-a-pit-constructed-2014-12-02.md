I’m currently stuck inside a pit constructed entirely out of my own sense of self-loathing. It reeks and clamours. 

However, I am hopeful. 

I always have been hopeful for my own sanity to prevail in amongst the mess. I don’t like the word “fight” because there’s nothing really there. Your own perspective doesn’t hate it. Your thoughts are just one big relative playground. 

I’m a working fool. I think I’m grateful for all the things that I have in my life. 

The broken tool in the shed, designed solely to fix precisely nothing. 

I suppose that’s a splendid prospect, my dear. 

I should take it easy. My notepad will keep me safe.
