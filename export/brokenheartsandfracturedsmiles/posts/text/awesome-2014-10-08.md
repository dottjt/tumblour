There’s so much in life to live for. So much. 

I’m currently learning Italian and French. I love it so much!

I have my last semester of university and then I have a degree. 

I want to learn metal fabrication so that I can build amazing things. 

I’m making a website on depression and I’m learning HTML, CSS and Javascript so I can build it from the scratch up! 

I have an amazing girlfriend who’s given me more love than the world has ever dreamt of. 

My CV looks great and I think I can just about get any job I want. 

There’s just so much more.

It’s all about how you look at life. My circumstances haven’t changed. I’m still the same guy that I was one week ago, however my attitude is in the right place. Rock on.
