So, yesterday was a bit of a setback for me, however that is okay. I am used to loss. 

I am going to get back to all my tumblr messages. Then I am just going to write. I am going to write all day until my face turns blue and I will make up for all the time lost yesterday.

I have been having the most amazing sleeps the past two nights. Prior to that, I honestly would not have been able to get to sleep. I would toss and turn all night long, it was the absolute worst. 

Basically, I have learnt to relax. I lie there and I just let my body sink into the mattress and when I wake up the next morning, all my muscles are so tender that I barely want to move. It is the most blissful feeling I have felt in months.

I will not create limitations for myself in my mind. I am better than that.
