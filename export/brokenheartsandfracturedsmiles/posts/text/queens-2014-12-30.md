Here I am in lovely Queensland and it’s interior demure is bright with sunshine and grace. The sandy beaches are dove with pretty women and I can’t quite stop starring at this gorgeous girl’s rack, but at least it’s all kosher fun for a man who should be locked up for marital treason. 

I bought a bright pink neon penny board for a fraction of a leg and I’m eagerly awaiting the day I face plant my humble structure into the scorching concrete, as a sign of human sincerity to the foreboding waves adjacent to my future hospital ward. 

Face reconstruction is cheap in a surfer’s paradise, where bones are broken to the veloce of the elements, burning like cheap rubber to the tune of decomposing anesthetic. 

In love I am with this beautiful shore; it speaks like flowers and glitters in company to a calm night sky. If only my cheeky eyes were adverse to the perversion they haughtily seek, shall angels and demons flourish like sand in a world of beauty and death and heat.
