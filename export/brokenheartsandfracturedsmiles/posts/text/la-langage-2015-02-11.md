I’m super excited because it’s officially been one week since I last orgasmed. However I’m really pissed off because my nails are too long and it really hurts to type on my mac. I’m currently at the State Library for a study date with myself and I’m super excited to learn and write so many new things.

I’ve noticed recently that I’ve become obsessed with learning French. God knows how long I spent yesterday writing and transcribing things into French. I guess more out of boredom than anything, but it’s something that inspires me as well.

Then it sort of hit me. I think the reason why I love learning french is because the english language dulls me. There’s nothing that excites me about it anymore. I feel like I can write just about everything using English. All the charm is gone. 

So instead, I guess if I learn French, it will open up a whole new world of expression. A new way of living my life. 

I’ve been contemplating for a while about which other language I should learn and I’m convinced on Russian. I’ve been learning it on and off for about 6 months now, but I’m just unsure. My girlfriend really likes Japanese, but I just don’t see myself using it as a form of expression. I was learning Italian, but it’s too similar to French. I feel like I should learn Spanish because of it’s popularity, however I personally find it difficult to romanticise Spanish culture. 

Mainly I want to learn Russian because of the handwriting. I think it looks so cool.
