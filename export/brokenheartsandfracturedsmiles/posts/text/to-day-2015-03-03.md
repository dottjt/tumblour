Today has been such an amazingly positive and fulfilling day for me. 

I’m not going to claim that it’s possible to make sense of life, since that would also ruin the fun of it, however I finally feel like I have some sort of grasp of who I am today and where I am heading tomorrow. 

It is a wonderfully beautiful feeling to have and fuck me, my girlfriend is also amazingly stunning. I could talk about how much I love her for hours.
