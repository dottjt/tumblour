I was at the radio station yesterday and I knew I just wouldn’t be able to get through the next two hours of recording, especially those ten minute articles, and so I ran quickly to the kitchen to make myself a coffee.

I must have put three huge spoons into a tiny cup with no sugar (I was doing a fast day, technically), filling the rest of the cup with water and my gosh, it tasted like smoke resin. It was like a I was drinking an ashtray. 

Then I was so jittery I could barely read the damn thing. 

Don’t do drugs.
