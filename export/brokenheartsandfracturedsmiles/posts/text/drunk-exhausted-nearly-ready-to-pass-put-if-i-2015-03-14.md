Drunk. Exhausted. Nearly ready to pass put. If I close my eyes I know I’m a goner, but my girlfriend is having a shower and I need to be faithful.

It occurred to me that if I weren’t in a relationship, there are so many girls I can meet in the city… but none of them are like her. Today while drinking I accidentally referred to her as my future wife (by accident I mean in a happy drunken stupor) and the amount of shock and happy surprise that spread amongst my friends’ faces was amazing. They’re jealous, not because I care about and love her, but because they know she feels the same about me too.

I’d better go make sure she’s okay in the bathroom.
