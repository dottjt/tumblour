So like, someone responded to my message by saying that it was “strange” so I wrote the most perfect response ever: 

“It’s not that strange if you completely suspend your disbelief and expectation for what words should be. Communication isn’t strange if it’s honest and endearing. I find it more strange to question the logic behind the words, rather than dismiss the opportunity for communication.”

Insecurity is one thing, however to let it fail your own sense of curiosity is… disappointing, to say the least.
