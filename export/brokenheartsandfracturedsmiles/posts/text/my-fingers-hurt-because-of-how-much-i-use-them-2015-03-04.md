My fingers hurt because of how much I use them. 

I’m basically always typing away at something. When I’m travelling to and from work I’m writing articles on my laptop. 

I’m dialing the phone all day at work in addition to using the keyboard. I continue to write when I’m at home, so yeah. I really love writing, what can I say. 

Okay, I have a little time to learn some French. 

Thank fuck I’ll be using a pen.
