I don’t like this concept of pride. 

There’s a complete absence of dignity and integrity within pride. It never hopes to give you a true sense of who you are, but rather obfuscate and consolidate a false sense of security, over who you think you should be in your mind. If there is truly no wrong or right in this world, then why must reality be obscured by any form of reaction?

Pride is an unnecessary function. You can live without pride, yet pride is a cheap fix for the confusion in one’s mind. Pride isn’t a true feeling of emotion, unlike happiness or sadness, because pride is an identity we keep close to our hearts, irregardless of the harm it may potentially cause towards ourselves and others.

Masks are not pretty when they’re worn without clarity. 

PS: It turns out this girl I used to really like on tumblr (and I’m pretty sure I had a pretty good chance) has a boyfriend and I thought she was lesbian and I’m crying on the inside.
