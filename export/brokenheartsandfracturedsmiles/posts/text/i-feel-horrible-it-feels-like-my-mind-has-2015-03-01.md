I feel horrible.

It feels like my mind has collapsed into a bitter concoction of old traumatic memories and signature codifications. My emotions are screaming at me to fight, but I know my demons have no empathy for communication.

Edible noise, you fucking cunt. 

That’s okay though. At least the expression is beautiful. It’s weird how I find tragedy beautiful. 

The human condition is fucked.
