I’m so incredibly lucky to have a girlfriend as beautiful and as smart as my girlfriend. I really don’t deserve her, at all.

She’s had her tumblr for a very long time and she’s got heaps of followers and she always gets so many notes, but she’s the nicest person in the whole entire world and she isn’t bitchy or slutty and I can always trust her to be there for me and be amazing.

With that said, she’s obsessed with sex and we had the most crazy sex this morning. She was wearing this kind of Japanese school girl dress and we fucked for ages and she wanted to do the whole student/teacher thing and I was exhausted and just couldn’t finish. She was so wet from squirting the entire time, it just made it impossible. So she rode me and I came.

She’s also got some pretty intense mental health issues (tumblr, go figure) and we’re working through it, but I trust her and believe in her and she’s gotten so much better and she’s doing so much to make it all work. 

So yeah, I’m basically bragging about my life because my girlfriend doesn’t ever recognise how brilliant she is and it’s my job to fulfill that role in her life
