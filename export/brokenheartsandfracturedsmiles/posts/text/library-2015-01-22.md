Today has been okay.

I finally managed to start writing articles for my depression website, I’ve been getting the hang of SEO, I completed a huge workout today and I had the opportunity to read some literature…

…yet it still feels like I’ve accomplished absolutely nothing. It’s like this hollow burn that follows me endlessly around the tree of despair. It’s still early days for my career and naturally everything takes time to grow. I need to be optimistic and patient, otherwise I may be forced to wither. 

That’s okay though. I see everything as a work in process and I think installing a system of variety will reach help with providing motivation to all the things that I do, so that I don’t feel too bored or overwhelmed at any one time. 

I don’t know what it is, but I just can’t quite keep focus on anything. I think it’s because I’m too adjusted to my environment and the comfort of my home is making me feel complacent to my own laziness. I need like, an office or something where there’s no distractions.

I think I might go the State library to get some work done.
