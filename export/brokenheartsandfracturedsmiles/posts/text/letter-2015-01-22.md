I think part of the reason why I’ve not been feeling so great lately is because I’m not giving anything back to the people who mean the most to me. I’m investing entirely in myself, while neglecting the people in my life who truly care. 

I’ve been working so hard to secure my career and it’s just really stressful for me, especially starting out. 

I’m going to start sending typewritten letters to people again. Especially my girlfriend. She deserves it more than anyone. 

I feel bad, because I’ve been prioritising my work and even my hobbies over her. She’ll be lying in my bed and I’ll be off working or doing something for my own sake, rather than being a good boyfriend and focusing my attention on her, while she’s there in my presence. Whenever she wants to watch a movie with me, I tell her that I’m too busy, but that it’s for the long term. 

Well fuck that. I’m going to spend an entire day doing nothing BUT watching movies with her. My relationship is simply too special for me to take advantage of and carelessly throw away.
