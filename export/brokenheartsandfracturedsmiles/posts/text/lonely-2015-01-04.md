I feel lonely, yet it’s as if this feeling of loneliness is a choice, rather than any possible significant value. 

The problem is that this sort of logic is lonely by design, like the great illusion we entertain in our minds. It’s as if all the meaning and human company we share within our consciousness, is this seemingly fragile house of cards, dictated only by how well they’re being dealt to you. 

Man, I haven’t smoked weed in ages and I doubt I’d honestly enjoy it again. I’m not even sure if I want to do acid anymore (oh trust me, I do), even though it’s my favourite drug of choice. I think NBOMe ruined it for me all. 

I honestly appreciate being sober, I think it’s a wonderful feeling; the embrace of reality in all it’s concentrated efforts. I hope to improve my memory and knowledge, not suppress it. The mind is a beautiful thing. 

There’s this brilliant saying that goes something like:

“We can handle knowledge of the truth. However we can’t handle the truth because we have no control over what the truth is.”

I’m not entirely sure if these words resonate to me, but words in general keep me calm. No more loneliness. No more calm. It’s a sea of understanding, than no one can quite comprehend.
