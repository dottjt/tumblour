Clothes are a basic necessity when you think about it. 

Without clothes you cannot find employment, rationalise with prospective partners or even convey any sort of viable authority. It is like the only thing between you and the outside world is fabric. 

You instantly become that much poorer, just for not wearing clothes. 

Except if youâ€™re in the webcam business.
