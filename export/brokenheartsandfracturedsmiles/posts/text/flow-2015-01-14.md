There’s this one girl I talk to on tumblr and she has the most wonderful prose.

It bubbles like a fluid porcelain inside you. Waves of flowers engulf the sky, as the vivid colourfulness of well-thought expression, converses dull pinks and ecstatic purples into an array of innocence that only children can admire. 

Her personality almost carries you away without excess. Chirp and optimism; humble-natured sentiment. It twists and turns smoothly like a winding road through a lush forrest. 

Her words are never forceful. They never try to pretend. It never aims to judge you or elevate you beyond that which her own heart burdens. It fails to plot and devise. We are all beautiful creatures with no true narrative but wind. 

It’s a beautiful roll of the tongue. It reminds me of vast meadows and wasted youth. 

lovely.
