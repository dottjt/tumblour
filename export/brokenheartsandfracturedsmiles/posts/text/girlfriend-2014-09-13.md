My girlfriend is amazing. She’s sort of like that daisy you keep pent-up alone in a glass jar on your window sill; forever living off hope and filtered sunshine. She used to have an amazing rack, but then she lost a bunch of weight and her breasts now look like a failed comedy duo on methamphetamine; desperately from the 50s’ and quaint. I feel like I’m being deceived, almost. I mean, how the fuck is a man supposed to snort coke off his girl’s tits if they’re bruised and battered from out of the box? Well, you just don’t. 

You give her a hug and a fake phone number; that’s what we call sympathy.

I’m joking. I really do love her to pieces. She’s beautiful, smart and has the most gorgeous persian eyes. I love her blush more than the world can fathom. I wanna tit-fuck her blush. 

Staring vaguely into the distance however, produces a much different result. You can see the words « slut shame » flash before your very eyes, consuming the pitfall of your dodgy miasma. Though morbid in all it’s extremity, I’d like to think it’s a fantasy worth pursuing. I stand up and grab her garden salad, flinging it onto the ground like a ninja star. You see, I’m not asshole: I’m her boyfriend.

A vicious cycle it may seem. 

I’m really glad that we get to be a tumblr couple, even though I’m pretty sure she refuses to associate with me online. I don’t blame her. Anyway, I’ve always wanted to have a tumblr girlfriend. The problem is that she’s not particularly flashy and it honestly disappoints me that she doesn’t reveal her breasts online in an attempt to hone in desperate, horny young boys to their death. She really does deserve all the dick pics in the world.

We have so much sex and I think it’s gotten to the point where I just can’t be bothered. I could probably never have sex again for the rest of my life. Cuddling is so much better; it’s a more pure expression of love.

Oh wait, what I mean to say is that we have the BEST sex; especially when she fakes it. I actually prefer it when she fakes it. I feel like I’m fucking a porn star. For the sake of arrogance, our sex is MUCH BETTER than the sex YOU’RE having. In fact, the sex we have is so good, that it makes you feel entirely insecure about who you are to the point of wanting to become more like me. I mean, how else are you supposed to have sex nowadays!? 

God, I wish I actually had a girlfriend. It’s so hard pretending.
