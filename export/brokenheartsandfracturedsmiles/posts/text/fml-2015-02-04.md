So I was writing this article for my depression website and it was more than 1000 words long and I don’t know if you’ve written perspective articles before, but they take a long time to craft because of how intricate all the logic is and it has to be meaningful and make sense….

…of course, I go to save the draft when the page crashes. This is absolutely fucking terrible. Oh well, we begin the process again. One idea at a time. 

*sigh*
