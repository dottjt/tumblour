Aaaaaaahh, well it turns out that high paying finance job essentially involves me using my own bank account to process other peoples money, which means having large sums of other peoples cash under my own name, which could potentially be sourced from drugs or other illegal sources. 

So I won’t be taking it. It is one of those jobs that could either be perfect or land me in jail for twenty years, so I don’t see it worth the risk. 

The initial rush was insane, but now the depression of the tide is slowly creeping upon me. 

If you need me, I’ll be applying for call centre jobs.
