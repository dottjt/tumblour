I haven’t updated my tumblr in a while, so it’s something I’m going to make the effort to do right now. 

I’ve started my first full-time sales job this week… and it’s in outbound over-the-phone sales. It’s so incredibly difficult, convincing people that they should buy something (education of all things) over the phone, however it’s a challenge that I find incredibly exciting.

I’ve been moving 110% over this past week. I don’t waste a single moment of my time. From the moment I wake up at 7:20am on public transport I write articles for my depression website and I spend all my lunches and breaks writing articles and then I continue to write articles on the train home. 

Then when I’m not writing articles, I’m studying how to make sales and how to handle objections. I only eat one meal a day at night time and the rest of the time I’m trying to get things done. 

I’ve been eating crazy healthy. Last night my mother threw a huge party and I completely refrained from eating or consuming any junk, despite arriving home at nearly 10PM.

I personally would love to spend some time learning French, however that is simply not within my priority.

The weekends however, is an opportunity for me to relax. I look forward to the weekend more than anything.
