I think we’re all mentally ill and it would be a great shame to delude ourselves otherwise. 

Of course, there’s nothing wrong with being mentally ill. It is merely a description we have for individuals who do not function as per what society would ideally expect - like a pack of efficient robots with no hope but in the progress we exhibit on the a daily basis to our superiors. 

Naturally I still have aspirations of becoming a robot, the delightful meanderings of a knowledge-spaced outlet, where function protrudes from the excess of my wisdom like a wind into an artificial breeze. 

Well, as my flu fades into obscurity, I suppose it’s in my best interest to get functioning and in lieu of the madness contained within my head - packed and ready to distort for another weekend on the prowl. 

It’s time to think about the future, as society would have it. Work. Work. Work.
