Okay.

I need to calm down, I need to calm the fuck down.

I’ve just been offered a high paying finance job (I know, what the fuck) where I get to work from home, 3 hours a day, 3 - 4 days a week. I get paid $3000 dollars a month and 8% commission on each transaction that is made. 

Then after the first month, my salary increases to more than $5000 a month and 10% on each transaction. 

What the fuck. What the fuck. Wolf of Wall Street bitch. I’m actually going insane. 

I’m going to buy all my friends the most amazing dinner. Then I’m going to get my license, buy a car and then move out of home and then I’ll be able to afford to take my girlfriend to Japan and work on my media and writing and OMG yesssssssss.
