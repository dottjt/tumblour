I’m having one of those stupid fucking days where everything is fucking stupid.

I’m clearly just a massive piece of shit. I’m feeling incredibly aggressive and agitated in my own mind. I hate who I am, like I deserve to have a glass pike shoved through the back of my skull and dragged along the road towards human genocide. 

It’s a terrible feeling, but at the same time I’m loving these words. I just know it’s the kind of thing that if I fill this page with morbid description, I’ll most likely be feeling different about myself. 

My body feels like it’s been emotionally raped. Existence is just the worst feeling ever created. 

This flu is killing me and really affecting my mental health.

I think it’s because it complete destroys my ability to focus on what’s important and so I create this vicious whirlpool of guilt, shame, anger and frustration. I eventually feel worse and worse about myself.

I’ve already binged so much food and now I feel sick. The masturbation really didn’t help and now I feel like the sort of scum that slivers into dreams and shits all over the landscape. 

It’s like I want to punch a wall, except that I don’t have the energy nor the will and even if I were, I would just feel even worse about myself. 

I should really take the time to meditate, but this self-combusting business is not working out for me.

The amount of shame running through me is like a waterfall of credulous garbage. What the fuck is wrong with me.
