Question: I very much enjoy reading what you write but sometimes I think you just have to be truthful and ignore your desire to make everything you write poetic and drenched in meaning.

Answer: You could say that I’m incredibly gullible and impressionable when it comes to my own words. I ball my eyes out whenever I watch movies and so when I write and express myself, literary narratives also have a similar affect.

I’m not myself when I write. I like to become characters and different personas and it gives my life a source of… excitement that I can’t quite explain. It entices me to explore the grammar and imagery. I love it so much!

It’s like when I message people. I say the most ridiculous things because I sort of detach myself from the words. It’s like, what me worry? 

So yeah, that’s why I sometimes write like a pretentious idiot. I understand that I often try to use this blog as a way to organise and convey my thoughts, however it’s the emotion that compels me to write. Otherwise I simply wouldn’t be relying on my words as a form of self-expression. 

Though, I do agree with what you say. There’s a time and place for everything and I often get carried away. Oh please, save me dear child!
