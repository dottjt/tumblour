Question: Another anon here! I must say, they put it into words. Your prose may be purple, but it's a lovely shade you're using. Your choice of words are fascinating to behold, and you are spinning a delicate web of artistry. I do look forward to your posts.

Answer: Oh, thank you! 

Ideally I would be a female with a lovely body to share, but unfortunately my breasts resemble charred tassels with a variety of flavours for the uncorrupted mind, ranging from exquisitely rancid to acrimoniously anti-grey.
