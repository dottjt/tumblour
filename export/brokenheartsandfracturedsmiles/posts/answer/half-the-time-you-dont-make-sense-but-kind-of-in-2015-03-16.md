Question: Half the time you don't make sense but kind of in that really refreshing, raw sort of way if that even exists. It's too poetic to really be truthful but I guess that what makes it special idk.

Answer: That is such a huge compliment, which would explain the massive smile on my face right now, as it drips like a hot candle wax into the pool of collective that keeps trodden like the slow decay of delinquent ecstasy you keep liquid in your soul. 

Ah, I see what you mean. 

Iâ€™ve always written for the purposes of poetry. I prefer romanticising my depression, rather than addressing it in a way that may relieve me of a my suffering, though it is not always the case.

I am much too in love with my own words to even consider the state of my wellbeing.
