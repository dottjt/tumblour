Question: "Irregardless" isn't a word. Irregardless, your left eye is looking good. Do yo' thang baby tramp. - Big Sean

Answer: Dear Sean, 

The sorrow is just dr i p p ing from my face. Oh please, you big fucking Sean; lick me with that gargantuan tongue of yours and fuck me silly! Fuck me and fuck me and fuck me while I squeal like an asian schoolboy; forever lusting in my favourite Cardcaptor Sakura costume as I sucky sucky foe yo’ money money. You got cash, right? 

There’s a deathly muse shrieking madness in the corner of my room. I want to speak to her, but she’s consuming a very delicate mandarin and it’s unwise to disturb a witch in her heat. My crossbow is aimed at her throat and I’ve caressed the tip with my indecent thoughts of Himalayan vultures circling sully on a bright Winter’s afternoon. 

Let’s fuck shit up. 

Your inner-trepidation is amusing, though weak beyond orgasm. I’ll have you dead by Wednesday, murdered by Friday, in-love by Saturday. You’re all mine. 

Sincerely,

The Vernacular
