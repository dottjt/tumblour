Question: Why are you poorly calibrated?

Answer: Well, I’m incredibly neurotic. I’m extraordinarily insecure about my intelligence. There are moments of inhumanity that surge within me and drive me insane. I never really know how I should be feeling and I overcompensate by feeling too much. I constantly worry about the way I manage my time and whether I’m making the most of my life. I don’t know how to relax. My mind is constantly switched on, intent on manipulating the reality around me. I take my life for granted. 

I’m obsessed with knowledge. I usually value knowledge over people and it’s stupid. I have a low level of tolerance. I have the capacity to be friendly and empathetic, but I prefer the sound vigilance of words. 

I have a horrible memory and it’s painful for me to deal with. I sometimes forget how special my girlfriend is to me. I think it’s because I spend so much of my time learning and discovering new things, that I have difficulty remembering the things in my life that actually matter. It’s like an amnesia for me.

It’s good in that time moves very slowly for me, as I usually live in the moment. Each day is a unique experience. However it’s bad in that I don’t appreciate the past. It’s as if it doesn’t exist to me, because I’m so focused in the now. 

This is who I am. A passionate delinquent.
