Question: I started off enjoying reading through some of your posts. Then you said things like, people that don't have friends to hang out with on the weekend should shoot themselves in the head, and also contradicted it with things like, i would have preferred to go clubbing alone. Then you said some shitty things about girls. And came off as extremely pretentious when you said you'd never been exposed to children of the middle-lower class. And now I'm just not sure how i feel about you.

Answer: Yep. Your experience with this blog is somewhat typical of the common reader. You know it’s good, yet at the same time you probably question the ethics and motives of the author. I don’t doubt your judgement because we’re all intelligent human beings, so let me express mine.

As a writer, I have one very simple job: to provide perspective in an entertaining way. There is no intent of malice, there is no attempt at ‘destroying reality’. I provide points of view and it honestly couldn’t be any more simple than that. Now I’m not saying that you have to agree with what I write, but it’s important to understand that writing is a complex art-form and that I treat it as such.

I don’t think it’s contradictory. I think you’re simply attacking labels here and the false sense of character of you’ve developed within your head. Who’s to inherently say that clubbing is a thing that should be with people close to you? What I’m saying is that people SHOULD have friends and that friends are vital to the human experience, irregardless of who you are, NOT that you need to hang out with them every weekend. I certainly don’t. The importance of my writing is that you really need to be pay attention to the message, not the words. I like playing around with grammar, so to bash the words, or even pay close attention to face value is somewhat shallow in the overall comprehension of things. Cmon, do you really think I’m asking you to kill yourself or is it really just a case of magnificent hyperbole? Never refrain from using your imagination. 

Would it also help if I said some pretty shitty things about guys as well? Put it this way, most guys are so shitty that they aren’t even worth talking about. Yet I think that’s part of the appeal of this blog. It’s no topic taboo, but it’s not to be taken as judgement. I’m simply trying to describe reality, even if said reality isn’t particularly nice. Yes, it may seem pretentious, but unless you read everything with an open mind, you’re only being judgmental without cause. I’m not afraid to admit what I am, because I am self-aware of that. I’m smarter than most people and I know how to write. Now is that really pretentious to say? On the flip-side, my penis is below average in length and growing up, I couldn’t talk to a girl to save my life. Just because I only express one side of the story, doesn’t mean that I’m biased or unaware of the other side. You cannot read this blog without being open minded, otherwise it simply doesn’t work. In fact, that’s the very reason why this blog works, because it doesn’t matter what I say, it’s fair game for everyone. I assume my audience is smart enough to understand that I’m not being one-sided and that am in fact a capable free-thinker.

I dish out a wide range of perspective. Perspective is to be considered and nothing more. Anything else is a waste of your time.
