Question: How many people do you talk to a day?

Answer: Quite a few. You could call me a conversation whore of sorts, I love to talk. I used to Skype everyday from 3pm to midnight, but now it’s more of a text thing, though I still love to converse. I always seem to forget how many friends I actually have, because we mostly neglect each other. Not because we don’t get along, but because we can afford the abuse. We’re all particularly well off in the friendship department, so I would argue that there’s an abundance of interest on both sides of the spectrum. Plus I’m an introvert, so I naturally like being alone anyway. 

Friendship is simple, it just requires initiative. I’ve met some of my best friends in the oddest of places. So long as you almost treat life like some sort of simulation fairy tale, you can pretty much get away with anything. Perspective, really. 

But it’s a good thing. You know, that thing called variety. There’s always a different personality to fall back on. Keeps life interesting. Though arguably an inconsistency in my thought process. Let’s call it my metaphorical brain tumor.
