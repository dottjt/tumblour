Question: blonde, brunette, or redhead...which is best

Answer: Well yes, if you’re so adamant as to objectify women to this very ideal of physical appearance, then possibly… brunette? It’s so hard to say. My basic logic is that the brunette would seem more composed and sassy, like something you would refer to from the 90’s. Throw in some glossy purple lipstick with a vague hint of grunge, and I’ll be over there within a heart beat.

Yet, there’s something magical about the concept of a redhead, much like a princess. Clearly perpetuated by the amount of porn I watch. With that said, there’s also something inherently cheap and disgusting about it. Perception is not my friend. Blondes are just… honestly, it depends on the individual. You know, indie blonde, slut blonde etc. I would argue that there are almost too many variations of blonde. 

Don’t even get me started on Koreans. It’s obvious I’m just desperate.
