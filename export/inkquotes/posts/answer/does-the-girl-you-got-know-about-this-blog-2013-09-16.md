Question: Does the girl 'you got' know about this blog?

Answer: Very much so. You could even say we met over Tumblr. Proof that words and substance triumph over this notion of the shameless selfie; the self-rejection of all that is brash in the downhearted attempt to proclaim our resident “Queen of Cute”. Give the words a chance dear, then we’ll let the fun stuff procure us to the procession. 

It took me three months of searching, trial n’ error etc. but I got there in the end, with not a visual cue to my ambiguity. To think, that all I had to do was be myself, which really was the hardest motivator to overcome, seeing as I’m highly irregular to most. 

Personally, I think if girls wrote actual blogs instead of reblogging images, they’d have more of a “chance” with guys, if that was ever their intention. Reblogging images does not demonstrate your intellectual ability. It tells me nothing about your life, who you are, what you represent. Though arguably it’s all about intent, so I don’t criticize anyone. Simply, fatal comment… with but a knife to it’s name.

You see, anyone can play the perception game. It’s a lot easier to post a scene from an episode of The Simpsons - so as to represent 90’s nostalgia - than it is to actually describe how you feel. This is why the very essence of Tumblr is more often abused than not. So you approach a girl having been given a false assumption about their character, as opposed to the rhetoric of the picture they posted only moments ago.

Arguably, humans are hypocritical and myopic. So everyone loses out in the end. Though to answer your lonesome question with the accuracy of your mind: Yes. 

Which can mean only one thing. That she likes me for who I am and as a further extension of my thoughts, is the most amazing girl in the world
