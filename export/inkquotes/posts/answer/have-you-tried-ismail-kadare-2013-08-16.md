Question: Have you tried Ismail Kadare?

Answer: I literally know nothing about literature. I’ve dedicated all my efforts towards writing. I don’t read, but now I realise how foolish that is.

However recently on holiday, I read Naked Lunch by William S. Burroughs, a recipient of the beat generation, and I fell in love with the darkness and the convoluted metaphor. Anything tragic is splendid.
