I guess in the ideal world, I’d be fucking my girlfriend everyday under the guise of our flawless romance, because that would be our thing. We’d wake up and have sex, almost consistently through out the day and at no point would it become boring, because the very presence of our collective company would be enough to make us smile. It wouldn’t be awkward. It would become natural routine. We’d talk about everything, because she’d be smart and interesting; open to just about anything. Even her own dilemmas; the very flaws that make us who we are. I’d be the kind of guy who’d make her laugh and feel good about who she was. She’d be playful and delirious, though it wouldn’t really matter, as long as we were both in love. Then by night, we’d be so exhausted by the whole thing that we’d have to fall asleep in each other’s arms, for the simple reminder that another day awaited, to be ready and do it again. Of course, our touch would never get too hot nor too cold. It would be perfect.

But no. Not in my lifetime. Probably never.

Animal crossing :D
