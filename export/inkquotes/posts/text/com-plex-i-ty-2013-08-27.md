You can feel the sadness lurk within, it’s dishonestly brash like rust. No one intends to slander the intimacy-coated perception we wear like diamonds, these words so pretty and bold. I would like to think instead, that my mind has manifest into such a pre-supposed state of complete atrophy, that even my own loneliness has been given the highest of honors; a place at the table of my own self-loathing. 

It’s incredibly difficult to give an accurate measurement on the amount of feelings we hold, tamper and possess. Anecdote is accurate, when men are you and me, but never like the falsehood of our own ignorance and solemn glee. Like a bunch of porcelain dolls from our childhood, the one’s we never owned. Their comprehension is futile to our voice that grows weak and old. The steady swing of an unstable axis, belongs only to the chaos of our living suggestions. flipper. flapper. flop. 

We all have our criteria to blame, the incessant calling of our cause. Not because they are called, but because they are reminiscent of the illusion we’re convinced of seeing. You are silly because you are hopeful, not because you slander without fear.

We are the delusion that keeps us whole. The spy in the mirror, the reflection you saw. A prick and a smile, be told. be told.
