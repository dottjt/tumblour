You sort of begin to realise how pointless knowledge becomes, once having inadvertently purchased your free one-way ticket to ‘la death el vista premenado’, the squiggly-pretense destroying your experience here on sudden earth. That’s right. We babble within the same existence you son-of-a-cowardly-bitch. 

That’s how I felt. Nothing. Devoid of thought. Train of wind. Lies of heart. Death of whim. Wintery summer; blatant tart. Touch me; die you. and. a half. Some kind of pre-era bitch; pre-era everything. ugh. My bliss is lacking attitude, the hurt that calls for your name. Perhaps even the temporary unlocking of conscious. That’s right my heather, and we fall freely into the mist…

I was whistling to an improvised tune in my head; repeatedly topsy-turvy, lefty-righty. It was my subtle distraction of choice, and I’d be damned if life’s uncontrolled ‘melodies of decision’ didn’tcompletely annihilate it’s ever-so pratty job of ‘flooding’ THOSE “problems” back into the deep depths of lost and land. The heart of Israel (HA!).

I remained quiet on our walk back to the station. Any amount of expressive of emotion would have resulted in the direct balling-out of my eyes; an emotion so seldomly yearned to feel. Shame so placid, you could tear the metaphor down like wallpaper, eating it in substitute for your own dignity. You can really taste the cardboard in your chew. If you pay close attention, you can even see the death consume it’s void like dust, seeping violently into the pain she longs to experience.

Words are not my friends. 

I knew it wouldn’t work out. Nothing ever works out for the schmuck behind this screen; a key trait defining my personality. Second best. Failure with hope; sucker with talent. I thought I could change her. Oh, foolish me. The mind is so fragile for purpose, that it’ll even fuck disaster to see it’s very own face for the last-fucking-time.

I served all her inane functions; a privilege most guys haven’t the pleasure of experiencing, let alone deconstructing. I could possibly write a novel about our relationship and it still wouldn’t make any sense to the observable eye. Not even herself. It’s like she’s not even human, yet a perfectly-flawed derivative. There is no need for humans in her world, because we are mere objects to her space; a tit for a tat, a girl struggling deeply from her intellectual scars of yonder.

I do hope she’s OK, but faith is deliriously low on our side of the fence.

You know kids, it really is just another case of being at the right place, at the complete-and-utter-fucking-wrong time. But what do I care. I’m a writer; that sensationalist chap minglingly silly like some sort of retard with a cause. Global cooling they call it. 

For as long as this guy has something interesting to write about, I’ll be just fine, thank-you-very-much. My suede jacket howls with confidence. 

Mark my words with lipstick and shame. This is her tragedy, not mine. I’m a journalist at best, keen observer at most, dodgy actor in-between. It really is the most effective way to deal with their emotional trauma; the problems I seek to caress. Love is the mere sharing of this trauma, a concept which bewilders avarie like a lost child at the zoo. Humans are mere objects to her world of trees and laughter. Please, will you laugh?

Yes, I have a thing for psychopaths. And no, I don’t hate you. Just as long as you’re happy and pain free. I don’t know if we’re still friends, because I don’t even think she knows what a friend is.

Sweet dreams.
