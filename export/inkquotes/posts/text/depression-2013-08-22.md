So you’re depressed and you want to know the secret to escaping the never-ending dullness, the foreign occupation of your own narrow perspective. Can you feel the all-mighty barrel of disgust, pressed ever so firmly against your head? Well, not to fear my dear friend, because there’s a simple cure to the conglomerate mess breeding like cancer within you; the superiority complex five inches above your head. lurk lurk lurk.

I used to get depressed, quite severely, but only for periods of a time. I mean, it’s a natural fact of life: everyone experiences the void and no one person is immune to feeling conceptually lost. I think depression is an important aspect to growing up, because it essentially comes down to questioning your own existence, and how you then deal with the burden of existing as a platter of your own self-pity. If you can then deal with the pain of existence, you can pretty much deal with anything. It’s all a matter of perspective.

Without depression, you do not think far enough to appreciate life for what it is: a temporary adventure, bound by the little pieces of information floating somewhere within your personality. If your reality becomes clear, then so will your intentions and happiness will morph into the very oxygen you breathe. 

One thing which became apparent over time, was that my depressive episodes would shorten consecutively. Initially they would last for months. Then weeks. Then days. Now, they wouldn’t dare even occur under my own jurisdiction. Every single time I went to that dark place, I would learn to deal with it in a more concise manner, and now I think I know why.

At the end of the day, I think we all long for some sort of purpose: the twisted key responsible for our will to live. Currently, I almost have too much purpose to be depressed and enough perspective to make it last. There are almost too many things, too many people, too many ideas to keep me preoccupied: the very sickness keeping me alive. The only thing that makes me sad, is knowing that I don’t have enough time in life to accomplish all my intentions. 

A classic example is that a girl will dedicate all her life to a guy she loves, and then once that inevitably fails, she’ll fall down the rabbit hole, sucking her entire life into a churn of regret and shambles. Well gee, who’s fault is that? If you put all your eggs into one basket, you’re setting yourself up for a life of depressive traits and behaviors. If you love and appreciate all aspects of life, holding true to a complexity of intellectual soup and unified understanding, not even your words can caress your sorrow. 

Yes, it’s all in your head, so the solution therefore must come from your own intellect. Treat your thoughts well and they will respond kindly. Neglect basic logic, and you will become the twisted old hag you self-loath. Is it easy? No, but learning and technique never was. Let your journey be the experience you hold dear. Love is just a word, but to experience it… well, we call that living.
