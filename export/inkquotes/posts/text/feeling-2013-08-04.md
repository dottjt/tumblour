I hate my feelings, because they don’t particularly care about my well-being. They don’t want to see me happy; control is much easier to come by when you’re down. Feelings don’t sense my pain, because they cannot sense at all. I just exist as an outlet. Like an insecure man locked in a confined room, forever gasping at what he cannot know; the constant, unloaded gun to the head. It really is the anticipation that kills you in the end. 

The problem with emotions is that they arise as a result of action, not as some overbearing force to be reckoned with. I don’t cry a lot because I tend to manipulate my emotions into bundles of justified sentiment, however I love the feeling of release. I think everyone does. People want to experience pain in the most benign way, because it’s not the hurt they’re looking for:

They want the emotion.
