I no longer see a point to this Tumblr. I mean, let’s be perfectly honest here. I made this blog purely to find a girlfriend and that’s exactly what I got. It was the source of my inspiration; the twisted perception that drove me to sickness and back. You know, perhaps I was never really was interested in writing or expressing myself after all. Possibly it was a reaction to my own dilemma. The smart man’s game. 

If you haven’t yet noticed the significant trend here on this website, then please do take a good hard look at yourself. I know I have. Most of the people here on Tumblr are massively fucked up; myself included. It’s a freak show of personality disorders, depression, mental illness, anorexia, sexual frustration, insecurity, trust issues, self-harm, tragedy and really, anything and everything inbetween. We use it to provide any hint of salvation, to the trauma rotting our minds.

Yet once we overcome our problems, it’s kind of like, well, is there really any point to the madness anymore? Surely there must be more to life than a bunch of consecutively repetitive images, preaching the same consecutive messages, over and over again, designed tentatively to reprogram our minds into believing ‘otherwise’? I mean, why the fuck do you need to be told that you’re special, over and over again, if you ARE already the amazing human being you purport? 

You are sick. That is clear. Not everyone. But some people.

Personally speaking, I’m incredibly happy at how things turned out. I had no idea what I was doing and yet here I am, sitting diligently with a smile on my face at end game. I honestly never thought I’d see the light of day, because as past experience dictates, I very rarely do. As a perfectionist, all you really have is failure in life. That is simply the perception in my mind.

At the end of the day, all I really had were my bunch of ideas about love and the very cunning I sought to abuse. I think that’s the best thing about this venture. I did it my way and I didn’t rely on anyone else to tell me how it should be done. I jumped into the deep end, learning everything I needed along the way, upon a bunch of clearly misguided, yet educated guesses. Most importantly I followed my heart, praying to dear god that his beacon of light would shine through and touch my soul. She was my savior. 

However before you make any judgments, please do take into heavy consideration what all my other friends had to go through, in this whole realm of dating and bigotry. To be quite frank, with my audience so small, I had it incredibly easy.

Too easy.

So many stories of being stood up at dinners, moves gone wrong, stupid things destroying dates, to even finding out that the girl all along, despite all the alarming signals flashing before their very eyes, never really liked them all along… I honestly feel as if my experience was a privilege.

People spend years trying to find that special one and yet, within a few short months, here I stand in complete awe to the love of my life. In retrospect, I have no idea how I got her. The past couple of months are but a blur to me. It’s as if the destination means so much more to me than the journey, because when you’re aiming for first prize, you cannot help but feel silly in your midst. 

To date, I’ve sent over 900+ messages to various people, just so I could get that special one. Talk about real commitment. Along the way I made some friends as well, so it’s not like I’m completely motivated but smut. People are people. Everyone deserves respect.

There’s not one thing I don’t like about her. My biggest problem with women is that I generally find them obnoxious. It’s a personality thing. I guess it’s like how girls think guys are insensitive and act like a bunch of dickheads. I have a similar sentiment with girls being too political and insecure. That’s just life. 

I think that’s why I ultimately decided to go the Tumblr route. I knew if I played my cards right, it would be the most effortless ascension to heaven. I’m good with words. That’s my specialty. It’s my talent. No buying stupid gifts, no dumb consumerism, no time wasted, no potential doubts. Only pure emotion, manifest into open love. What could be more beautiful?

Though I still want to use Tumblr to make friends and meet interesting people. You can look, but you can’t touch babe ;) Except my words. Let my words violently molest you, in the cutest way possible
