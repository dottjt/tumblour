I love my girlfriend more than the world. I talk to her everyday and I constantly tell her how much she means to me. I flirt with her, I talk dirty with her and I make her laugh and feel comfortable about who she is. She is the most precious thing in the world, next to my frail heart, and I try my best to make her feel special whenever I have the opportunity. I want to make us the best experience in the world, because I know if I show my love, she will do the same for me. 

Some say it’s needy, some say it’s obnoxious. Hardly. Until you are in my position, there are only negative feelings associated with jealousy and desperation. The whole interaction is entirely voluntary and that’s what makes it work. It’s about understanding each other and how you correlate value with your time. That’s how you do a relationship.
