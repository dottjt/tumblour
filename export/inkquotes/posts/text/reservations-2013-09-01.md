I’m quite reserved and intimate. I don’t particularly like showing off, but that’s not to say I’m not shameless and confident. I’m just not the kind of person to pointlessly impress people outside of my friends - in the name of ego - because I find the whole thing too brash. That’s why I don’t post Facebook statuses, because I understand that I don’t need to continually send subliminal messages to my friends, in order for them to get who I am. My real friends already know who I am.

I remember absolutely despising the class clown in high school. For one, I was much funnier than him (and he knew it too). Secondly, I can’t stand it when people laugh at unfunny jokes. Part of me dies to see wit go wry. I was the kind of kid who would only tell jokes to the friend sitting next to me, because I liked the exclusivity of the situation. So what would happen, is that he would crack up and everyone would look at us like, “Wow. What the hell did he just say?” 

But the point of being intimate, is that it rewards those who are close to you and the people who you think are your true friends. It makes them feel special and it gives them the feeling that they’re in onto something others aren’t. 

I absolutely despised institutionalized education. However it offered me a good dose of perspective, for which I am glad of. Throughout my entire life, I managed to be in every single position. I was the popular kid, the kid with no friends, the hated kid, the funny one, the average one, the smart one, the dumb one, the bully, the bullied, and everything in-between. So by the end of it all, I wasn’t so much shaken, as I was stirred. 

I was offered to become a part of every single group. For example, one time I made this joke to the entire class on Year 10 camp and everyone went insane with laughter. Out of nowhere, the room absolutely went beserk. It probably defined me as THE funny kid. This was during one particular dinner and I’d just come back from the toilet, when I’d shouted it out to everybody.

Anyway, I go back to sit down with my friends at our table, and all the popular kids start coming up to me and inviting me over, asking me to say more funny things. Note: I cannot stand it when people ask me to be funny. I just tell them to fuck off and yet it happens so many times. You don’t just “be funny”, you can’t just force jokes out of people. We’re not machines you tard, we’re fine observers. It’s a natural process and the moment you start pressuring someone to perform, it just becomes a dirty little game of losing all tangible respect. 

Anyway, they even went offered to kick another popular kid out of their room, just so I could sleep in their cabin. But I said no and I refused them completely. That was my opportunity to actually become a cool kid, but I had too much integrity within me. A similar situation arose when we had to do a one minute review for a book in my English class and the same thing happened again, except this time with the art-fags. Yet again, I turned them down. 

The point is… well, possibly that I’m just a cunt ;)
