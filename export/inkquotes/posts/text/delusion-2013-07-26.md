If I could crush you, I’d buy you instead. Use you as fodder, the cat on my floor, the gleam in your eyes. Do you cry when it hurts, when the pain becomes love? Confusion, your method. The disease you cherish.

I know your name, your fake little game, the tears on your verandah, don’t buy into my name. Your perception untold, unanswered, unsold. Eat me now before I melt into your conscious. Break my fast with your nails and tears. Make me real angry, make me your taste. Sell these emotions like fish to the sea. 

Never ever give your soul away…
