I’m not sure where to start because there are just so many aspects to write about, however I thought I might start with the obvious source of my misery: the rave.

If you haven’t been to a rave, it’s perhaps the most hilariously disgusting spectacle you will ever lay your eyes upon. The reason why my night wasn’t completely wasted, is because as a journalist/writer, I don’t particularly loath the experience I am subjected to. At the end of the day, I don’t care what this sodden body goes through, so long as I have something interesting to express. What the night did provide however, was a good dose of perspective on life; the commodity I value the most.

I’m quite new to the whole going out and socialising aspect of life, because it hasn’t been routine until recently. I mean, yes, I have friends, but we don’t really go to clubs or bars. We sort of remain within our own little world, lurching off the warmth we provide to each other. However lately I’ve been making an attempt to go out, perhaps in the search for something greater. I guess we’ll find out eventually, or maybe not. Consider this a learning experience for us both. Maybe you’re like me and you don’t like to venture out on weekends? Well, not to worry, because you can now follow me through my torment, in the comfort of your very own home. 

With that said, I obviously have no clue what I’m doing. I went to nightclub last weekend and it was pretty fun, but I had no idea what a rave was, so the worst I could do was at least go to one and observe the conundrum of a shit night out. 

The biggest problem with the rave is that it’s just TOO MUCH. Too loud. Too extreme. Too many people. More importantly, too many dudes. It’s a sausage fest in there. You could almost taste the sweaty perspiration of dick within the intermediate atmosphere.

As a result, the rave takes itself much-too-seriously in almost every aspect. It doesn’t simply allow you to chill or party when you want to. It’s too full on; there is no chill aspect at all. Everywhere you go, it’s either too loud or packed with people. There’s no where to simply sit back with being subject to unnecessary stimuli. Outside is the worst. It’s like a haze of cigarette smoke and placid women. 

The sheer size of the event makes it incredibly confusing and indirectly, skews the very purpose of the event. Rather, what is the fucking purpose? Here’s the problem. Since there are so many activities, not to mention the length of the night, the variety of rooms, number of people etc. it’s so incredibly hard to gauge where people are at and what is socially acceptable. What I mean is, that a person may be fucked off drugs, too awkward, doesn’t like you, doesn’t want to talk to, is already with someone else etc. It’s simply impossible to interpret these things.

There’s no one mentality to grasp onto, so every single interaction you make is an indefinable risk and chances are, you’re gonna lose. I’m just a friendly guy who wants to talk and get to know people, and the rave environment is inconductive of this. Take for example, the dance floor. There are so many people and the music is so fucking loud, that it’s almost impossible to single anyone out. Further more, is the person there to dance, simply have a good, do they want to hook up etc etc. The dancing itself is hilarious, as everyone awkwardly shuffles like a bunch of dyslexic fish. But I don’t care what people think of me, I’m just there to dance and have fun.

The whole thing was ruined for me, in a sense, that the main room had too much going on. There was a lighting spectacle, so half the people were there so see that, probably a quarter of the people were dancing and the rest were at the bar or sitting along the corners, so it was very jaded. There was no complete experience, it just felt like it was trying to achieve too much. Personally, I think you want a unified sense of purpose at an event, not like a zoo or theme park when you can just go and do whatever. Either make it all about dance or all about blah blah blah. 

Ultimately though, I realise this comes down to the very concept of scene and which scene is right for you. The rave scene just isn’t for me. Though raves are much different to traditional clubs, so please don’t be deterred. 

Let me describe the rave scene to you, at least in this particular establishment. You have the old-timers, the people who have been going to these things since the inception of time. They’re much older and they’ve already established a concrete set of friends which are basically impenetrable. They’re not there to meet people, they’re there to do their own thing. Then you have the newcomers, who are absolutely clueless as to what they should be doing. It’s obvious, because you almost end up subconsciously hanging with them half of the time. 

Special note to the stereotypical, fat ginger retard shaking his booty at the back of the room. The expression of complete wonderment on his face, really did capture his lack of sympathy on everyone else’s behalf. Though I’m sure he had a great time. 

More importantly, let’s focus on the type of character that appear at these events. Let’s put it this way, I come from a certain racial background, though influenced by a very upper-middle class upbringing in tastes. As a result, I’ve only ever been exposed to these kinds of people (oh god, I sound terrible, but I’m trying to be as inconspicuous as possible haha) through out my entire life and my perception was, that this is what everyone from my background was like. How I was, oh, so wrong.

What I noticed, is that everyone kinda looked similar to the point of a statistic average. Then it hit me like a strike of lightning: everyone WAS average and all the same. These are the very children of the average middle/lower class that I was never exposed to. The children of laborers and small business owners. Everyone looked the same. Same haircut, same dresses, same make up, same clothes, same face, only with different variations of body size, height and muscle mass. It’s no wonder I felt so out of place.

The club/rave scene is actually quite hilarious in it’s tactics. Here’s the gist of how it works. From what I gather, at least from my own limited experience, is that you have a friend invite you to one of these events. He introduces you to his friends, and then you go another night and you meet these same people, only now they’ve got a few new friends with them. So you meet those guys and then slowly and surely, you build enough friends to create a repertoire of club friends. Over time you continually meet new people and you officially become part of the scene. 

Somehow by the second night, I’d met a bunch of people who’d only just been clubbing twice as well. That’s what I found so peculiar about the whole experience, how you almost unexpectedly meet people, by association alone.

I think that’s fucking stupid, because it’s not genuine. You don’t really have a choice in who you befriend, even if they are all friendly, because it just becomes a matter of effort. It’s an incredibly easy way to make a lot of friends, which a bunch of people you honestly could care less about. 

An important lesson I learnt from that night, is that it ultimately comes down to what you value the most. You have to ask yourself the question: What is it that makes you happy? Here’s the thing: I’m already happy. My current existence makes me happy. So why do I even need to go clubbing? 

We all appreciate our time differently, so if you can focus on the fundamental questions of your existence, then everything we be as smooth as butter. Slather me fuckhead ;)
