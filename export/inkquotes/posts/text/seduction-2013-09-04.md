I think I can understand why some women feel uptight about men. It only takes one bad experience to mold a mindset and I have some of the worst friends when it comes to the way women are treated. I’m pretty sure my cousin beats his girlfriend, though the whole thing is so ambiguous that I don’t know if she actually dislikes it. I can’t say however, that I agree on either side of the spectrum, as I think both men and women are inherently retarded. I mean that as a collective, not as a specific notion.

I think it’s a vague generalisation to claim that it always comes down to sex for men. As someone who studies seduction, I think it more succinctly relates to the area of ‘game’ you desire to play. Seduction is honestly nothing more than technique, but my integrity transcends well beyond my impending desires to fuck. It’s really not hard to convince a girl to like you. However personally for me, it simply comes down to a matter of “Is this really how I want it to play out and do I want to make it this degrading, yet simple?” as opposed to the end outcome of success. 

My psychopath friend was very keen on this idea of manipulation and control. I remember his tales of how he managed to conjure several women under his control. They would obsess over him constantly and as a little experiment he would flat-out denounce them, only to see his minions return with even more fervor and attachment. Apologizing for his feelings and making small gifts to regain his trust, there was no real line of decency. Though really, none of this is out of the ordinary. This is basic textbook seduction. It’s important to understand that not every girl is susceptible to this type of seduction, only the highly vulnerable ones. 

The funny thing is that he didn’t even love them. He was only doing it to kill time. Yet I always thought the very idea of manipulation was stupid, because as per this notion of equilibrium, you’re only going to end up manipulating yourself and as you can imagine, that’s exactly what his antics lead to. The girls began to hate him and he was the one trailing a weak heart.

As the good guy I am, I may have gotten involved and blatantly told them the simple mantra of: “This guy is retarded. Stay away.” Hilarious I was ignored to the simple trance of their own delusion. So who’s to blame for this situation? A bunch of blind girls or my friend with his malicious intent? 

The problem with both guys and girls is that they hold dear to their weak little minds, this idea of outsmarting the other gender. It’s precisely this attitude that ruins things for everyone. Mind games are just a cheap excuse for substance; the intellectual depth lacking in their presence. People fail to realise that there is no 'smarter’ when it comes to love. It’s simply a matter of sodden preference. 

My biggest problem (though really, what problem?) is that I understand seduction too well and more often than not I’ll end up hating the 'game’, as opposed to using it to my advantage. Here’s the problem so-to-speak. I find everything stupid to a large extent. I find people highly irregular and irrational. I find society stupid. Politics. Popularity. Perception. You name it. 

So instead I like play my version of 'game’, not that pertaining to the official rules of understanding. How stupid is it that you cannot even approach a girl at a nightclub, without being handed a death-stare as if you’re there to rape her, when really you were just keen to have a simple conversation all along? Why on earth would I want to fuck a girl who wears the exact same makeup and outfit as every other girl in the room, let alone someone with the very air of arrogance to assume that they’re even possibly desirable? I just want to gauge your opinion honey, not fondle the superiority complex five inches above your head. 

The same goes for social circles, particular when I hang out with my drug gang crowd. You see, they take things for face value. Whereas I care not of perception and thus social standing. So I’ll frequently make insensitive comments and these bozos will take it literally and get offended. Oh, deary me. The number of times I’ve been threatened to have my head beaten in piles within the thousands.

There was this one guy who was known for staunching people and he was the biggest motherfucker I’d ever seen. Clearly the work of roids. So I approach him and ask if I can shake his hand. Immediately afterwards I say: “Now you can’t staunch me!” and oh boy, you should’ve seen the death stare he gave me. I tend to fuck around with danger. 

So what happens is that I end up rejecting traditional notions, doing the complete opposite to what is actually 'acceptable game’ or at least via an improper method, in the hope that I actually attract someone who also finds the whole thing incredibly stupid as well. So as you see, it comes down to the 'game’ you’re willing to play and the very idea of integrity you inhabit or lack entirely in residence. Clearly I don’t fit many people’s idea of 'game’ so the common jokester will have to suffer within the the interim. 

Retarded, I am.
