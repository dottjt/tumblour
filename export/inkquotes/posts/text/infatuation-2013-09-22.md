It’s gotten to a point in our relationship where our love is so strong, that we could simply hold each other for the eternity of time, knowing that our relative presence is enough to last us forever and ever. I can only imagine how magical her touch will be, when it succumbs to my brittle perception of her overwhelming beauty. The beauty of her heart.

I’m really anxious at the idea of meeting her at the airport, because I just know I’m going to break down into tears. I act brash at times, but deep down inside, I’m soft and emotional like cotton-candy.

Though it’s becoming a little problematic. I’ve basically neglected university in all it’s entirety, as well as every other aspect in my life. So we made an agreement that we’ll limit all our transactions to an hour a day, preferably some time at night, so that it gives us something to look forward to at the end of each earth cycle. 

We love each other immeasurably. That’s certainly not going anywhere. I think the most amazing thing about our relationship, is how understanding we are of each other. We understand how amazing our love is, and that in the ideal world, we’d be with each other, every single chance we had. However we also understand that we live in a functioning world, with aspirations other than love. We don’t judge. There’s no room for that in our relationship.

I know it sounds like such a terrible thing to say, and I feel bad saying it, but is it really healthy to have only one passion in life? I mean, I will always treat her like the best invention in the world and she will always be my strongest attachment, but whatever happened to hobbies I used loved? The other things in my life that added meaning to my day? 

What I’m really trying to get at, is this idea of how we express our love and what is truly necessary. Is it really necessary to spend 8 hours a day, to spread what is the essential message of “I love you”, when it could be done in little less than a second? Ultimately we do it because we enjoy each other’s company, however I compare it to leisure, as opposed to necessity. In terms of priority, she is the ultimate leisure one can have, however it’s still leisure none-the-less, like playing a video game etc. Work and university on the other hand are necessities. 

Yes. You can entirely replace your existence with this concept of loving another person. However I think it’s about a balance of quantity vs quality. Love doesn’t die when in the company of quantity. It simply piles on-top of each other and I think that’s a wonderful thing.

So let’s extend this love to other things. The things that made me happy in the past. Surely ice-cream gets a little dull after eating it everyday? Well, not my precious
