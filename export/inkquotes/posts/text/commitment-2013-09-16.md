I’m freaking out about this girl. You have to understand, this is my first time in any sort of relationship and I’m honestly overwhelmed by the whole thing. I find the experience so weird, because it’s not as you’d expect. You have no say in direction, because everything just happens so organically and it’s so damn sudden. In fact, neither party really has any say in the whole thing, unless if you want to terminate what you’ve already built up, which feels like M.A.D. at this point, considering the amount of effort we’ve put in. 

Once you find the right girl who you feel compatible with, participation literally feels like the only requirement you need, in order to keep the ball rolling. Your chemistry with the other person will drive the relationship. All you really need to do, is to be yourself, not act like a complete retard and the magic will transpire from both your fingertips. It’s like there’s no effort, no friction. Worst of all: No control. I don’t think anyone could possibly be ready for this, especially when it’s your first time and you have no idea what to expect. 

Like a shadow, creeping across the landscape, I already feel like I’ve been trapped into a committed relationship. How so? I don’t even know. I feel like I have to talk to her and that I don’t really have a choice. I guess it’s borne out of love, but it also feels like I’m being sucked into a black hole. It’s not that I don’t enjoy it, because I really do. It’s just that I feel a part of me has died in the pursuit for something more. I don’t feel like myself anymore, and it honestly feels like I’d have to lie to her if I’d want some time alone. It’s certainly what all my other guy friends have done (though to be fair, I have completely neglected my uni work since talking to her). 

What I’m going through feels fairly typical of what most guys have told me; especially reflecting the comedic rhetoric blurted in movies and cartoons. Though the thing that oddly disturbs me the most, is how perfect the whole thing is. There’s no conflict, no opposing force. Zero friction to speak of. It’s almost as if we’re too perfect for each other and now the only thing left to do, is let fate take us away into the moonlight. No mind games. No disparity to keep us apart. It’s almost like the best part of our relationship, is also the very worst. 

I feel like there’s no escape. Yet do I even want to escape, or is it just the freedom of choice I long for? It’s so weird not being able to hit on other girls, when it’s pretty much all you’ve been doing for the past couple of months. Though I could never actually cheat. I’m way too soft and guilt-ridden for that.

I really do love her company and I certainly have no desire to leave her. It’s just that I feel like there’s no say in whether I want to or not. My emotions have me intact; held captive to a cause I do not even know. But really, I’m simply describing my dilemma with the words I love to play. In all honesty, I’m enjoying the whole thing and it is rather addictive, so I guess my plan is to just traverse down the rabbit hole and see where it takes me. I have no regrets and she’s amazing; that I cannot deny. I’m really just treating the whole thing as a new, fun and exciting learning experience, that I plan on making the most of.

Rationally speaking, being with her makes me happy and if I weren’t with her, I’d probably be depressed, so best I just take the situation for what it is. Positive perspective is good perspective, no matter what you experience in life. After all, this is what I sought for from the very beginning, so to complain would be absolute madness and a sign of sheer hypocrisy If you do not try, you cannot buy. I’m a sensible guy. There’s really nothing to worry about. Not to mention, she’s hot as fuck ;)
