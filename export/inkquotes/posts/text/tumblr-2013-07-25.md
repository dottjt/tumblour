Tumblr doesn’t love you. Tumblr doesn’t care. Tumblr is the fascination plaguing your incompetence, displaced and unheard; throw away the silence you placid whore. Don’t make me waste my time.

Oh yes, flow and diddly celebrations to the dumb cat with nine lives, and a fuck you too. Did you hear me? FUCK YOU TOO. Of course, that would just be rude. Let me bore you to sleep. One. Two. Three. Fuck. 

I am blind, because my eyes cannot see. I am silly, because my brain is retarded. Duh! and a fuck you too. Oh, why am I so defunct, like the draw of a pistol? Can you not stand still? I cannot breathe among this cluster-fuck of a response towards this prenatal insolence. Crying and churning, you are the friend of my disaster. You are the Tumblr of my existence.

Tumble. Tumble. Tumble. 

Stop, you fiend.
