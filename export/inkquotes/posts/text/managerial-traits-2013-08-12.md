So we’ve got a new replacement manager for our department and I think she loves me. She touches me in certain ways, she’s a little more playful with me, we share the same intellectual depth etc. This is coming for a department which composes mostly of fit, tall, Caucasian guys, though we all have different merits. I just happen to be funny and charming.

My prior manager hated me because she was quite the tomboy, whereas I was a little more metaphorical, philosophical… finesse? I was still the hard, physically capable worker anyone was, however we lacked that spiritual connection to pull us forward. I was dirt to her. So basically over the past three months, as a casual worker, shifts haven’t been coming my way at all.

Come present day and there’s a big job that needs to be done, so everyone needs to be recruited. Anyway, me and my work friend do this thing where we insult each other, however he’s a complete dumbass and I’m a grammatical genius, so I always tear him apart every single time. He just reuses the same three lines again and again, and as a comedian, I can’t stand repetition and I hate people who reuse material. That’s the thing with me, I’m witty as hell. Not one person has been able to out-wit me so far. I’m just too good. I don’t even need to try, it just flows from my mouth, as any good improvisation should. You can thank my piano practice for that. 

So we’re in an aisle, throwing insults at each other like it’s shitty Christmas and she happens to be working with us there (oh gee, I wonder why). Basically, she loves my sense of humor, which is the very essence of who I am. It’s a very smart sort of flavour, not cheap like homebrand. That’s the hilarious thing about this Tumblr: I’m absolutely nothing like the guy who writes these words. I’m a fucking comedian, this is just the emotional depth passing through your mind.

She was saying stuff like: “Wow, where have you been all my life!?” and the big kicker: “How old are you?” Who the fuck asks for someone’s age out of nowhere? The constant laughter is a dead give away. It doesn’t even matter what I say anymore; the trance has no end. 

So yesterday I mentioned the whole avarie situation, how she kinda doesn’t want me, how I was emotional vulnerable and on the verge of tears, blah, blah, blah and guess what? She put her arms all over me. I think the key of this type of seduction, is to not seem interested in the other party, but continue effortlessly to deliver their goods to their front door. 

I like her in the same way, though I’m not particularly fanatic for a couple of reasons. She’s pretty and understanding, however she’s 30 years old and she’s my manager. I treat it more like a nice sort of feeling to play with and you can bet your ass that I’m going to start getting shifts from now on. I mean fuck, I’m the smartest guy in my department. The way I talk, my mannerisms, my attitude. Never be arrogant; always be humble and appreciative towards others - that’s what smarts are really all about. Perhaps intelligence is best measured in the number of flaws you don’t have? 

She loves me for it.
