The great thing about my Tumblr is that it’s anonymous to the public, so I can essentially write about whatever I want without scrutiny. Let’s talk drugs. 

Over the weekend I went with a group of friends to this poorly built shack in the middle of the nowhere. There were about nine of us, mostly teenagers and some delinquents, however I got along well with everyone and thankfully the anarchist didn’t mug me, though I was constantly threatened at the murmur. I still don’t know if he was joking. 

Anyway, the more local faces managed to get a fire going, as the drug taking brethren proceeded. I can’t remember how much I had, but I believe I had taken too much at that point. My head was spinning. Some of my friends took tabs and you could tell they were having fun. I was sitting next to this art-fag actor. Obviously he was hot, tall and Caucasian, the general type I despise by default, though he was nice. We certainly got along talking about complexity. 

I went back with the anarchist to his house at around 1am with three of the other guys, in a complete daze and a half. His room is perfect. It’s a man-cave of sorts featuring a built-in kitchen, toilet, bedroom - you name it. Let’s not forget the heating, something which my dwelling lacks. 

Though not all was well. My anarchist friend (I’ve only met him twice) is a mix-bag at best. You can tell he’s a caring guy, but you can also tell he’s in a lot of pain. He described how he’s been fucked off drugs for the past 34 days and how he’s constantly trying to kill himself. In essence he’s a bottle-full of contradictions, swaying back and fourth between saying he hates drugs and how they’re ruined his life, before preaching the exact opposite moments later. He’s a weed fiend. and it’s especially apparent when you have a couple of cones with him. Gee, though name a drug he hasn’t done. Last time we met, he took 6 strong sleeping pills which he says gets him more smashed when taken with weed. 

He’s a particular fellow. He talks proudly of taking on three cops at once as a brilliant fighter, how he carries a wrench and box cutter with him, the people he plans on murdering because of their wrong doings, as well as the cars and police stations he’s blown up. His latest plan involves becoming a heroin junkie with a mate for a full month. Some friendship that is. His life more-or-less, revolves around taking drugs and playing video games. You really should see his man-cave. 

So this cunt manages to talk some tabs out of me and he’s absolutely off his head. Abusive, delusional, out of control. I barely think he can be trusted sober, so you can imagine he’s off his nuts when on psychedelics. 

Eventually it progresses to 6:30am in the morning and I hadn’t even a lick of sleep. I was dying from something, that was for sure. 

I doubt I want to meet him again, especially once he turns junkie because I will most certainly be rolled. I made sure to eat as much as I could at his house, just to take advantage of heaven. I really cannot control the munchies, though thankfully I exercise and eat healthy in everyday situations. 

The journey back was pure pain. I missed my original bus stop (which took 35 minutes), so I foolishly decided to wait for the bus to loop back, because I had no clue where I was. Some hour and a half away, I end up in Frankston. So I get off, take the train to the city, then back on the line where I live. Missing my stop for a second time, I’m prompted to take the train on the way back and really… fuck me. I was THAT tired, I could barely function.

TL;DR

I’m sure you have better things to do than read about my dysfunctional teenage lifestyle.
