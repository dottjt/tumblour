It happened. It was stupid. But it was an experience. Oh dear, oh dear. 

So me and two other people were out in a pretty far away, dodgy part of town. We’re walking up this skate park and there these are two other guys there just casually smoking up on the ramps. My friend shouts out to them and they say hi back. This is where they started to get aggressive and come towards us. One guy had a meat cleaver, the other was the crazy small one and they were both coming towards us.

At this point, I break out into a smile at the stupidity of the whole thing, which is a big no no. They obviously start going down the whole “What are you laughing at cunt!?” routine, and yet oddly, I couldn’t have been more calm. I honestly take dangerous situations for granted, because I never truly have the urgency in me to act. I’m just the journalist. At this point, the guy with the meat cleaver comes up to me and he happens to separate me from my other two friends, because they ran off ahead.

I decided to run. Unfortunately, I ran off in one direction in the hope that one of the guys would chase me and the other guy would go for my friends, to all give us a chance to escape. However obviously they both ganged up on me and in an intense run, eventually caught me. It was quite the effort, I would’ve actually escaped if I knew the area well enough, but when you’re oblivious to the terrain, you can only gauge what you can see, especially when it’s night.

There’s a terrible feeling that goes on in your head once you get caught. It’s your first strike, your first warning. What can you possibly risk then? Surprisingly they weren’t rough, I think it was more a confidence issue. Once they have the confidence over you, it’s like they’ve already won half the battle. There were so many times he left his weapon on the table, because he knew I didn’t have it in me. I didn’t. 

This is what I hate about being the journalist. I’m a keen observer, but a terrible actor. I over-think situations, because that’s what I’m naturally trained to do. I analyse, yet instinct is really what you should be relying on. It’s also why I felt so benign to the whole thing. 

He’s going through my shit, questioning what I have. They do this thing where they instill the confidence in you that they’re friendly if you co-operate, and they make it seem like some kind of voluntary exchange. Generally my strategy is to smooth talk and I think I did relatively well, not that you really can in the face of adversity.

So there I am. Getting rolled. Thankfully, they only took the small stuff - all my cash, my atm card and pin number, even my iPod. Gee, I did lose a lot of cash, I may struggle over the next couple of months. They didn’t take all my other cards, my phone and the rest of the shit. Hilariously he said he wouldn’t take my iPod, but you know, there’s no arguing with a meat cleaver once that sucker goes straight into his pocket. 

I think most people would’ve been scared, cried even. My two friends certainly were quite emotional at the whole thing, though I remained incredibly calm. I sort of just laughed at the whole thing and in a sense, I was just grateful in general to be living. I mean, what else can you do?

After we regrouped, the figther friend was incredibly dissatisfied. He’s quite strong and physically built, very much a fighter and was angry at a lot of facts. He felt he shouldn’t have just left me there alone, he certainly felt a lot worse than I did. Honestly, the situation didn’t turn out too well and could have been prevented, but we all fucked up to an extent. Mr. fighter shouldn’t have decided to go to the skate park when we saw them, he probably shouldn’t have talked to them, I shouldn’t have smiled and I should’ve kept with the pack. The whole thing really was one cluster fuck. 

So once we regrouped, they were all like: “Are you OK?” all that shit, and honestly, I couldn’t have been better. If anything, it was them who needed the attention. I don’t generally suffer trauma, I’m above that. I’ve seen and heard some pretty terrible things in my life, but my perspective on life is generally unaffected. A lot of people would be in shock, or would be scared to leave the house, but not me. That’s why I want to be a war reporter, I think I could handle the stress. 

This is where it gets scary. So my fighter friend is pissed off. He’s the kind of guy who could’ve easily taken on the two, yet he felt he was indecisive in the moment and honestly, no one can blame him. It was our first time in this kind of situation, and no one knew how to act. So he says fuck it, and runs back to the scene of the crime. It was an incredibly brave thing to do, because I certainly couldn’t have done it. I was scared for his well-being, praying he would come back. 

So he’s left for a while and I asked my friend for a cigarette, just because it seemed appropriate. We’re waiting like 15 minutes and eventually we see our friend come back. His face is bruised and he got punched up, but here’s the story. He approached them and the small guy ran off immediately. The other guy punches him and then he goes postal and smashes the other guy, before our sorry lad runs off. Once we get back, he surprisingly hands me my iPod and it couldn’t have made me more glad. It fell out of the guy’s pocket. 

I found it weird how they were pampering to me, when really I thought he did the braver thing. He was the hero in this situation, I was just the casualty. It was a tough night. But really, and I can’t emphasize this enough: I feel grateful. I really, really do. Not angry, not frustrated, not sad, not scared: grateful.
