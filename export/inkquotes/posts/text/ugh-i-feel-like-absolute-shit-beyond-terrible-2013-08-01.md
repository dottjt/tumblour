ugh, I feel like absolute shit. Beyond terrible, but it’s a subtle flavour of hate. I guess that’s the trade off for feeling like king over the past two weeks. Kick me off my throne and into the never-ending depths of my own fallacy. Let’s leave this to a night of terrible tragedy, agonizing emotional pain and some kind of juncture with the devil. Drugs. We’ll needs lots of drugs pronto. Looks like we’re in for a amazing night of quote writing ;)
