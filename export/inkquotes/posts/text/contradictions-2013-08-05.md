I sort of just melted today. I don’t think melting is healthy, but my psychiatrist says it’s good for the libido. What a complete slut, the bitch doesn’t know shit. She can barely keep her own thoughts in order, let alone transcend reality. 

By the time I get to the fridge, half my face had fallen off and my mother goes and does that thing she always does; the same fucking routine every morning. She starts complaining about the trail of water from my bed, like I’m somehow responsible for my own chemistry. This is serious business woman, I don’t need your pampering you dumb bitch. I decided to have a glass of water, but my mouth had become this gaseous representation of my own incompetence.

I fell to the floor involuntarily, before dissipating into the atmosphere; one atom at a time. But at least I got to keep my dignity, now 5000 light years away from earth. I do miss my family.
