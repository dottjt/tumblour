Controlled demolition works a lot more effectively on the outskirts of your own emotions. I can still remember the image of her sodden body lying there in plain sight among the glow of her blood-shot suffering, deliriously confident in stature, curled up into the bundle of joy I’d left her. 

Wasting away into the life she never had, my eyes were laden with all sorts of images. Blue. Green. Death. Blood dripped from her thighs into the canister below, like the free form emotion she had sought from my love. Her only defense, only my only weakness; oh please dear god, break me from my fast.

I can still remember that feint taste of something, foreboding over the remnants of what was no longer mine. She was the reminder of my promise, the hurt that mimicked my lone soul. Bitter and harsh were the words I’d encounter, only to see them live another day. My shame was adamant; the scheme of pertinence eating away into my thoughts. Ouch… and the pain is gone.

The look on her face, ever so innocent. Quiet; like the frame by frame destruction of my consequence. Dignified; only in material theory. Once a lesson taught, always a lesson lost. Why won’t I cry?

Her beauty remains only in my thoughts. However the girl, a pretty one, remains no more.
