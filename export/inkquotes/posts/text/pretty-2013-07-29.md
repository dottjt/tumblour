So you don’t feel very pretty? Ideally we’d have to choke you to death and dump the corpse out back. However thanks to recent innovations due to our operations far east (oh, those Chinese sure are hard workers,) there’s now a simple cure for that thing called your face! Consumerism, my darling in beaten rags, the limelight of my wallet, please lead us the way! 

For only $29.95, we’ll have you (and your ego) up and running; smiling like an old man on his first symptoms of stroke! Two wrongs make a right, so let’s get cracking! First, we juice the personality out of you into a small cup, until the pain becomes a fact of life. We then filter out all the insecurity, before selling it direct to Kellogg’s as dog food… for cats. Oh wholesale, you cheeky bugger! You’re a winner! 

We then throw away the cup and wala! You’re good for a lifetime of wholesome groping and sexual advantage. Who said it had to be your advantage ;) 

No fears. No worries. No function. I mean, that’s how you thought boys would like you, right?
