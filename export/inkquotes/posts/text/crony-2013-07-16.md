It’s true. I spew my miraculous tendencies around like I’m the town whore or something, bitch, and people just BUY THAT SHIT UP. That will be eight fucking dollars, you piece of faggot. 

Myself along with ‘the extension’, my team of deliriously drunk assistants standing OVER THERE, have come up with a cure to the sadness you pertain. First you must 'sad’. Then we must crush you into a pile of dirt before churning you into a highly rotating perpetuation, also known as gravity. Or was it the seven seasons? Oh, unfortunately it looks like we’ve killed you. 

Well played. Under played? Just get the fuck out of my imagination.
