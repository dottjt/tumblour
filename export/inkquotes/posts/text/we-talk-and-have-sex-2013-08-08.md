She’s perfect. Undoubtedly, we’re perfect for each other. The person in question is highly intelligent, has personality and is sexually open to just about anything. Yes, over Tumblr. What more could you possibly want? We had sex the first night we met; a massive fuck you to the ignorant souls who thought I was pointless and naive. 

I don’t think she could have said it any better herself: women’s standards of men are way too high, perhaps to the point where they no longer remember why they bothered in the first place. Women in general are too insecure, too shameful to just… be? Supposedly ‘slut’ is a bad word and the world must be a more senile place as a result. Why must perception be a terrible thing, when love is just a chemical of the brain? 

I’d like to think I’m perfect for her as well. She certainly seems grateful for my presence, as I am of hers. I’m funny, nice and caring. Girls always love the funny guy, because it’s not just a privilege, it’s a raw talent. She loves my cooking as well, another added bonus. There’s nothing I can’t do because I’m no dummy; only too honest for the 99% of people in denial. All girls need to do is be open and honest, otherwise they ain’t gettin’ a piece of the complexity pie. 

Though really, I think this proves something. That by being honest and appealing to yourself, you can do anything given enough time. I made a Tumblr account 3 weeks ago to prove this very point. Happily, I did just that. 

…and to think, bad poetry and illegible quotes created this little scheme of smutt and sex for the next couple of years. I don’t even have a picture of myself, nor is my name visible. I’m a fucking genius ;)
