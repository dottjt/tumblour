So this girl I have sex with, she’s quite the specimen. I’ll say it now and I’ll say it again: she’s perfect and I try to tell her everyday how much she truly means to me, even if she doesn’t believe it herself. Of course, I’m quite the journalist, which is why I’m compelled to record our experience. It’d be a greater waste to ignore the potential - the true tragedy of not living. 

You could say it’s every poet’s dream to write about sex, smutt and endless romance. She’s very special to me and I 100% guarantee that I will never meet another girl like her ever again within my lifetime. Statistically speaking, it’s impossible. There will always be sluts n’ whores, there will always be endless stereotypes to rely on. But not her. Never. You shall know about the sex, the drugs, the love, the incessant mind-games, the public indignation, the everything. And yet in spite of the knowledge, you won’t even begin to understand a fraction of her life; the special bomb that makes her tick. 

I love her like a girlfriend, but I treat her like my whore. She’s perfect and no one ever has to know who she is
