I’m incredibly desperate by anyone’s standards. Of course, the key is in not showing it. That we call ‘confidence’. 

Look hard enough into my puppy-dog eyes and the subtle molecular foundation of my perceived reality will pierce you mundane, like the great hallucination of a knife through the skull. You know, duh! That hollow structure shouting helpless for ego’s intimate touch; the personality you call home. On either end of the bloodbath you’re either desperate or you’re dead, so at least you now can remain content with the clarity of your own perpetuation.

Desperation implies passion and to a lesser extent, that you’re at least worthy of some menial purpose or goal. To the true person with no face, other than that of their own physical implication, life makes you nervous, though proud. It hurts to think about the things you love, because it destroys the sanctity of your own existence; the eclectic flowing of energy between our own blood and the soul we don’t own.

It’s the tension of excitement creeping in tandem, behind the lonely thoughts we isolate and deprave. The disappointment we know all too well, plastered like a decoration of regrets upon our white, fridge door. Oh, such a bitchy conception to praise. Preparation is the most futile of concepts for the 'man of desperado’, because anticipation is only a killer of mood, unlike the savior we do not know. 

You know dear, a little thing I like to invite on my ever-so frequent 'date rapes’, are these horridly placid episodes I call “whack-a-fuck”. What you do, is you grab the largest object you can find and willingly, attempt to beat the living-crap out of yourself, until the blood in your body is no more. It always ends in some form of death (of there are many), however thanks to the intellectual development of humanity over the million year period we call 'decency’, I am simply a writer with a wild imagination. So please suspend your disbelief, honey pie.

Give me your rabid smile. Arbiters must eat too.
