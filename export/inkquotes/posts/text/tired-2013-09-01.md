My vision hurts, like the subtle remains of a burnt-out log; the flickering of my cornea into bright sparks of agony and pain. Here I am coughing up incessant amounts of phlegm; the comfort of my release. I don’t think I’m sick, but anything’s a possibility nowadays, what with rabid nature and it’s grasp on chemistry. The western lifestyle and it’s false sensibilities. 

I really feel like punching something, just as an expression of my own fatality. I feel like a zombie on life support, whatever that means. Jolt me with life and praise me with speed. Godsend. 

Is ‘hope’ the word I’m looking for? Probably not. 

Give me your riches.
