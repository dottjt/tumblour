So I guess if I were to exaggerate here for a tiny speck of your time, the key to a successful seduction would be to keep your subject constantly within your grasp, but only under the guise of an illusion. You need to have them think about you, every single moment of their living existence. When they wake up. When they eat. When they shower. Of course, the number one tool you have is time.

The problem that most people have, is that they treat time like it’s their enemy. Rather, silence is your friend. 

If you talk too much, then there’s no effort on their behalf. In general, you can never talk too little. It’s almost like a condescending tease, or a neg as they like to call it. A little fuck you AND a hug at the same time. What more could you possibly want in life? 

Clearly this is a fascination of my own creation. Generally you don’t want to attract people of the same type, because it’s like trying to jam a circle into an unfixed oval. Though really, this is just a unfulfilled obsession of mine, to be manipulated and played like a toy at a candy club.

Why must girls have all the fun? Subconsciously we all want to be slaves to purpose, i.e. Say hello to your nearest cousin Mr. Motivation. Make me your slave and we can both pretend to play owner.
