Well, basically art = perspective. It’s quite a simple permise. Oh, so many pppps 

I have this obsession with art and with drugs. I think I’m probably too emotional and soft for , wow. Maybe clubbing, though we can’t make this fairytale too perfect now. 

Life is stupid. Let’s put it this way. We’re a bunch of 7 billion human beings, not to mention all the other life here on earth. Some of us eat. Some of us don’t. Some of us live in complete poverty. Some people have so much capital, that they honestly wouldn’t know what to do with it. There’s so fucking many of us, that we have to create hierarchy so that we can maintain a relative perspective on how big the whole fucking thing has

I’m sorry. I’m listening to music while tripping and it’s the best thing I’ve ever done period. words are just t

Oh god, now I know why I wanted to kill myself again. Life fascinates me way too greatly to be tampered by anyone’s account. I live in complete fear every day. 

I mean, words are great, but jesus. 

Capitalism has really fallen off it’s porch though. What really and I mean REALLY drives me insane, so that history repeats itself almost perfectly. That means, there’s was another person like me, at some point in the past, with the same fucking concerns. BUT WOW> CAPITALISM IS FUCKING AMAZING WHEN YOU HAVE INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL. You may as well call it sex. 

I guess I feel sorry. I guess I feel anxious. You could say that a great disaster is happening, but no one is really going to pay attention to the guy with all the charts, because apparently those charts don’t look pretty enough. So then my job, suppposedly, is to make those charts looks pretty so that retarded. depressed teenagers like yourself 

Humans don’t give a fuck. They just need to get paid and they’ll do anything. 

Oh god, why must I describe everything? Well, because I’m a historian of sorts. Call it a form of complex OCD. But yes, if you do it with style, you can get away with it and call it popular culture and all that is fine. 

WOW. You really do have to listen to that Gaga track while having all sorts of shapes manipulate into you, and out to you , and it’s the greatest feeling in the entire world. I feel like my brain is orgasming, I’m pretty sure I never got this from sex. 

I think that’s the problem with sex. All you really have are the images and associations, yet the actual sensation becomes nothing more than death in comparison. 

Wow. No one wonder women never did it for me. All I was looking for was perspective. 

I mean, words. Structure. Good.

Oh look. They fit into little boxes.

perspective. I love this drug. words are. are. well, when they’re coming at you, it’s a little hard to tell, but it’s fucking amazing. Women are good too. Everyone is good. I think I like everything . I just want to cuddle by myself in a corner, like a small girl. 

This is the greatest ponzi you’ll see yet. You’ll WISH you had 

Well, capitalistic was never supposed to be sustainable, however now you can consider it more a form of willingness to give in to what is already there. So, I mean, we don’t really know where our money comes from. We kinda just work, and people get paid. That’s the economy.

So, what we do is we \

Of course, I’m just the fool who remebmer ist all. this is wayy, TOO PERFECT.
