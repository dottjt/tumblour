I’m willing to say that the truth is a sickness. In today’s capitalist society, humans are obsessed with this idea of possession. We want to own what isn’t ours, because possession is the key trait in domination.

Yet the truth cannot be owned, only misunderstood. There is no ‘getting reality’ because reality exists irregardless of our actions or thoughts. The truth has no agenda, only fabricated knowledge to fit a bunch of inconsistent theories. Bias is the enemy we all sleep with, the greatest treason of perception. 

We all have some sort of reality we can relate to, and I think this is what inherently makes us human. The idea that we are intelligent and conscious. What we call humanity, is really just a universal concept that all intelligent life share. Dogs are human in that sense, as we are dogs. 

Labels are futile. Let’s hope sleep is a little better.
