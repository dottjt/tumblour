I’m going to keep it simple as to why Keynesian economic policies don’t work. 

Fundamental economics requires that you follow the basic laws of supply and demand. You want, I give. It honestly couldn’t be more simple than that. If you fulfill the needs of supply and demand, you will have the perfect economy. Whether it grows of not, depends on the productivity of it’s people.

Keynesian economic policies on the other hand, don’t care about the demand side of things. It only cares about increasing supply. Spend. Spend. Spend. Put simply, it’s an incredibly easy way to buy votes: the very cunning of the modern politician. 

Keynesian economic policies assume that you can spend your way into the perfect economy. You know what happens when you spend more than there is demand? You create a misallocation of resources, which then leads to economic bubbles. Artificially created bubbles always burst, leading to financial crises. What do you think caused the GFC?

I don’t trust either Rudd, Abbott, or any politician for that matter, because I think they’re all a bunch of paid for shills. But let me tell you about how the economics of the situation works, because it was always comes down to money at the end of the day.

Politicians make a bunch of promises they cannot fulfill without borrowing an extraordinary amount of money. Rudd is predicted to create over $250 billion in deficits over the 08-16 period. The more promises they make aka Rudd, the more money that has to be borrowed to gap the deficit: money that does not exist. 

Guess what happens when we increase supply without increasing demand? You effectively dilute the value of demand, meaning, you dilute the value of your currency, the very currency we all use to pay for things, and this causes price inflation. Imagine adding an extra $250 billion to the money supply, with no goods to chase it? Inflation is nothing more than a hidden tax on your own wealth. It is completely malicious in every respect. 

There is no such thing as a free lunch. Just look at how much the price of things have gone up within the past ten years. That is not natural in a functioning economy, however it’s been sold to us as something “normal”. LOL the general public will just about believe anything they’re told. These politicians are not getting this money sufficiently from taxes, they are printing it out of their fat asses, so that you lose your purchasing power on the things we buy.

Consider it a vicious cycle. Since everyone is poorer than they were before, as the value of their money has now suddenly decreased, people now demand even more governmental assistance to help them with their needs, which means borrowing even more money, so that people can become even poorer within the future. Keynesian policy is central planning, which is good ol’ fashioned socialism with a different hint degradation. This is exactly how the soviet union collapsed. Fair and square. 

Rudd is not doing this country a service and Abbott is naturally retarded. Yes, his policies sound amazing on paper, but you simply have to ask yourself the crucial question: Where is he getting this money from? 

Of course, this is only one element to the whole fiasco of why I hate government and public perception; the basic economics that isn’t revealed within mainstream media. I could easily write a whole book on the subject, as finance and politics is my passion, however this isn’t what my Tumblr is about. I simply wanted to write something important and besides, I’ve been doing this for such a long time, that I find it much easier than writing about my own life. 

…and to all the people hating on Abbott, you’re just about as equally retarded for liking Rudd. At least Abbott is gonna save us some coin, you know, that concept of living within your means. Though I’m not enrolled, because I can’t stand the political process. I haven’t paid any attention to this election and I plan on avoiding the fine by saying that I couldn’t vote for religious reasons ^^.
