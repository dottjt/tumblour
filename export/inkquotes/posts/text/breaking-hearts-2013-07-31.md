Breaking hearts and distorting perception. You could say it’s my line of work, a motivation turned sickness. I train the words to love you bitch. Collapse. Alphabet soup you go. I force the grammar into your air, the pollution that speaks softly like the touch your thigh. Empty like a pot of dreams; take one and pass it on. The trust forever lost.

You only listen to what you want to hear… because you’re pretty like that. Aren’t those dimples just extraordinary? You serve to toy my function, the function you do not own. The illusion is pretentious because love burns like rubber. Smell it to reality, oh sweet delicious crude.

Better to remain unconscious than to collide into uncertain hands… I believe they call it ‘style’. You may not pass go.
