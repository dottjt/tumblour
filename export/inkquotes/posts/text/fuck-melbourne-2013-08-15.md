Cafe’s disgust me. I don’t understand this obsession with perception, because all I hear is the hollow ringing of my heart compounding profusely; perpetuated by fake images of teetering and insolence. Most people feel compelled to celebrate occasion (note: temporary) like some kind of depraved animal longing for nutrition via waveform. What kind of a life demands occasion? What happened to existence without ego?

So you look nice and your feelings have been wrapped around in five different types of sellotape. Breathing has no longer become a function, just the silly afterthought haunting your dead body, lying ever-so disturbed on the blue and white patterns corrupting your conscious. It reeks like rotten flesh, but at least you’re safe, right? Your doctor recommends the peace. All that’s left to do is to hand over your wallet and everything will be just fine. You’ve become so opaque that even almighty Zeus of Nazareth cannot tamper with the delusion you have usurped. You are a god in his mind, so please destroy the creation you do not own. 

Girls want to look pretty and guys have massive dicks. Yes, words are a harsh mistress, the tale you refuse to hear. Or are you just not listening clearly enough? 

Metaphor is a lost talent. Please don’t lose me in the vain.
