Everyone needs some kind of vice to put up with the bullshit that is life. Though I have a better strategy. I take psychedelics. You see, what they do is help you manipulate perspective so that you can see things more clearly. All you need is an honest heart, and your soul will be as clean as sheen. AS SHEEN. Now, onto the purge: 

When all you do is hit on women, with good intention mind you, it makes you so superficial that you’ll want to regurgitate yourself and die. You’d find more meaning in my phlegm, in amongst my dead body lying on the floor. Let’s go through all the stereotypes, shall we?

Some people like to put on make up and “pretend” they look a million dollars, before realizing that this perception is simply a figment of their own fucking imagination a.k.a. a complete waste of their fucking lives. Gee, I didn’t know personality had to have a mask. Unfortunately most never figure it out.

Other girls are so insecure about “seeming open” a.k.a being a slut, that they don’t even know what they’re trying to prove. Is this even a conversation we’re having, because it feels more like I’m trying to tick a bunch of fucking boxes. Nice? Check. Doesn’t kill people? Check. 

Then there’s the complacent crowd. Oh god, how I hate these fucking “I’m happy to just be who I am.” Yeah, fucking bullshit. That’s why you’re overweight and have nothing interesting going on in your life. IF YOU’RE BORING, THEN WHAT THE FUCK IS THERE EVEN TO SHARE?! That’s probably the biggest turn off for me, a complete lack of originality. Oh, so you like television shows do you? Oh great, now please fuck off and die.

Then there are the truly, TRULY depressing women, who holy crap, actually have more than ONE dimension! Go figure! Gee, my brain feels stimulated, I wonder what that FEELING is!? Of course, they’re so fucked up in their own world, you’d spend years trying to claw your way through the red tape.

And you know the sad thing kids? These ones are usually your best bet.

And as per usual, all the perfect ones are already taken ;) WAIT. WHAT PERFECT ONES?!? WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU EVEN TALKING ABOUT!?

So please ladies, I understand that life is difficult. I empathise, I’m not retarded. I really do. But when you make it difficult for smart guys like me - not just difficult - but soul destroying, you not only destroy the sanctity of life, but the weaker version of myself would have probably killed himself by now. But thankfully I live for the tragedy, NOT TO SEE MY SOUL DIE.

Of course, this is the game you play. I have no one to blame but myself. Thank you and good night. Can you NOW see the SHEEN?
