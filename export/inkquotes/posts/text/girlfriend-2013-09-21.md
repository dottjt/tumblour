I wrote a bunch of things about my girlfriend, but I never really decided to publish any of it. Anyway, each paragraph is an entirely new sentiment. Concede:

She comes over in 35 days and it’s been 9 days since I’ve masturbated. The latter honestly isn’t that difficult at this stage. It’s the fact that we can’t touch each other. 

Every time we talk, our love for each other grows stronger. It’s like you think you love her, but then once you get to know her more and express yourselves more openly, your present love becomes incomparable to the past. It’s incredibly difficult to claim what’s lust and what’s true love, because you can’t describe or feel true love, without having experienced it first. So every day feels like crossing new boundaries.

I’m not sure if this a failure of expression, however I felt I loved her more in the beginning, than she loved me. I guess I’m a little desperate and romantic and we all appreciate things at a different pace. Though now I feel that she’s definitely more of the cute little love-bird than I am. All that really matters, is that we love each other and that we aim to grow this love every single day. The impression I get is that when a guy says they love a girl, it’s like, yeah sure. But when I girl says it to a guy, it feels so much more legitimate and conscious. 

I haven’t been sad or even vaguely depressed, not even once, since our relationship got serious. 

The fact that we have to wait such a long time, is honestly killing us both. Though I think the duration makes it all the more special, because it’s a struggle we both have to go endure. As they say, good things come to those who wait. I honestly cannot imagine how magical it’s going to be when we see each other, face-to-face, for the very first time. I feel giddy just thinking about it. 

We’re so adamant on fucking each other that it’s driving us insane. When I say we want to fuck each other’s brains out, I mean that sincerely. All we want to do is express ourselves sexually in every single way possible. Rough sex, soft sex, stupid sex, public sex, any kind of sex. We talk about all the kinds of sex we want to have. The clothes, the places, the situations. Everything. 

I’ve been comfort eating to distract myself from the fact that we won’t be able to see each other for such a long time. Not to mention, I can’t masturbate, so please give me a break.

I sexted her for a full hour over Skype message last night. It was odd because it sort of just happened out of the blue, though she wanted it. I really was doing it purely for her, as I did 90% of the typing. I basically played the dominant role; she was just there to be manipulated. As fast as I could, I typed as much smut as my imagination would allow. How worthless she is, how she’s only good for fucking etc. My hands were jelly by the end of it and not to mention, I was completely spent emotionally. Honestly, I don’t really see the appeal, though she said it got her really horny and wet, so I assume I did a good job. Thank fuck I learnt to touch type with Colemak. I knew it’d come in handy ;) 

I’m the worst when it comes to being hopelessly romantic. I’m pretty sure I lose all sense of being whenever I try to flatter her. But it makes her laugh and feel special, which is what counts. I write her the most wonderful poetry and we just adore each other immensely. We experience the most intense love, possibly ever. 

This is how I’d describe how she looks: Think of a classic 1950's British air-stewardess, with pouty red lipstick, white pearl necklace, extensive short-curl brunette hair. On the other hand, also think 1980’s fitness instructor, with thick curly hair, spandex swimsuit and headband. Two very different perspectives, though I hope it helps paint a complete picture. 

If she buys me a copy of Grand Theft Auto 5, I will finger her so hard that her ovaries will explode and kill everyone within their vicinity. I have two desires: She has to suck my dick while I play GTA5 and she has to snort speed/coke off my penis, just so I can say a girl did those two things to me haha. I just know will we be the best possible lovers for each other
