You know what I find incredibly lame? The fact that someone has to be down on themselves, in trouble, in pain, in doubt, in sorrow, in whatever negative form of emotion they may be, in order the receive any sort of compliment or reassurance, kind words, if you will. That or appear cute.

So then what happens is that the people who do feel adequate about their own lives, the true role models of what people aspire to, the stability others long, become decrepit on the inside and they begin to feel hollow for their lack of conceived love. You can’t teach an old dog new tricks, but you can show it compassion. 

It seems that you’re only worthy of a compliment on Tumblr if you’re either a cute guy or girl, or if you’re into self-harm etc. and I don’t doubt the people their choice. But you know what, when most people speak of equality and human value, the double standard of what Tumblr represents, this isn’t exactly what I had in mind. 

Why should it matter who a person is? Isn’t everyone equally worthy of a nice compliment? Why wait till the person wants to kill themselves or is in a state of depression? And she’s cute. So what? If everyone spent enough time obsessing over how they looked, we’d all be picture perfect. Because that’s all it is. A picture. The very irony of Tumblr.
