There’s a silence out there that fails to realise it’s own fate. No consciousness to bring it forward, no face to tell it’s tale. It knows not of it’s existence, but of the tragedy of it’s own shadow in partisan with one’s lack of faith. No one can hear it. No one can care. Some would like the privilege of saying hello, but not the game silence. It has no reach, no identity to obscure. What could be more pretty? 

It’s the concept of mystery that holds us ransom to our fate. The suffocation of the your in-determination, the focus that dissipation cannot tame. Who will crumble with five lives to play? One for you, two for me, the rest that never existed. 

I know the pain is subtle, but please try and smile. try. yes. please.
