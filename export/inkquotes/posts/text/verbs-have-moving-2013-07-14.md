So let me get this straight. You’re special, right? Like a stream of flying colors in the sky, suspended forever in the iridescence of your own brilliance… chances are, you’re also cute. Oh please, my mouth is already gaping into the void you’ve created; the black hole of my existence. Succumb to the pressures and liquidate into my arms…

dreamy. dreamy. Wake the fuck up and lick the sun.
