Complacency is the rabid disease of our own making, with all intent of malice and protrude. A creature of all-consuming disdain, eating away at will’s tendency to thrive and exist. Every day of every hour, awash with the lies that purpose has ingrained, forever growing like a cancer in our ecosystem of pure innocence. Nothing can be true, when observation brings pain to our very eyes; when vision is the weak acid burning into the tracers our only remaining conscious. Will you understand the collapse of your own neurology, tumbling into spirals of mania and destitution?

There you sit, like a fiend with no time. No place but inward, into the unknown of your own creation. It hurts to even think about inception, because you are a joke with no arms for legs. Tell us another punchline dear, to only see your lack of presence crash down onto the floor; the greatness your hope to perspire. We don’t help victims, we kick them back down. 

I know your stupid little game. The one that cycles happiness into cute little boxes of agony and pain. Oh, but look at those pretty little ribbons of pink and grey, as they compliment the asinine nature of your own petition. Don’t believe. the. words. All I see are bunch of rotten attitudes, burning holes into your now incomplete logic. You’re happy. You’re sad. You’re fuck-wit. 

Don’t try and act all funny because the fog is not your friend. You are only blinded by your own stupidity. There is only confusion in the mist, the vomit-inducing taste that seeps into your skin. It takes insanity to believe in your own confidence, but a brain to truly conceive it. Purpose is the scar formed by your own actions, so please jump off a cliff into the reality you do not hold. Cut yourself down, pretty girl. Your survival depends on it.
