Pinging. Your head is pinging. Bits of green and yellow explode into your brain; the sleepiness prevailing into a mosaic of broken dreams. Zooming past into your own reality, what if you could just SEE? The mirror hath no purpose, only the reflection of your desires, those sickly beings of clinging and banging. If you listen closely, you can hear the whimper silently die into the paper, as it absorbs the life out of you. 

Donâ€™t remain a simple thought. Transform into an idea; expression, the red tape you slander.
