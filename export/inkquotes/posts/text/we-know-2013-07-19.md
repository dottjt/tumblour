BAM. That my friends, is how you move on. The crushing anti-matter, compressing your thoughts and emotions into toxic little bundles of false air. Breathe me. Oh yes, breathe me till you die. 

Surely life is one stream of constant disappointment, the tragedy which feeds your agenda. Maybe I like these pretty words more than my success, so that I can bask in the plethora of heart-destroying syntax. Redundant. Useless. Atrophy.

Not to worry. While I don’t think it’s appropriate, nor possible to get used to such a disparity, it’s the complacency that’s really killing me. Please stop exaggerating the pain.

It only makes my job harder.
