I wouldn’t be able to begin to describe how tragic I’ve become. It’s a subtle form of degradation that feeds on itself, that listens in on it’s own feedback, to slowly infiltrate and destroy the perpetual desires you once loved. The very desires you thought were your friends, as Billy with the knife there stabs into your throat and jerks you down those flight of stairs.

I love being tragic because I don’t see it as a form of hopelessness. Pray tell, I’m actually quite a rational and controlled human being. I love tragedy because it’s so benign, it’s not real, yet it crushes your conscious like a ton of bricks. It’s like playing with perspective and destroying reality, all at once.

If you’re not tragic, then you’re not human. Tragic romance is like having your face twisted into meat grinder, before realising that the pain was the greatest experience of your entire life. I’m that guy, so please, feel free to break my heart.
