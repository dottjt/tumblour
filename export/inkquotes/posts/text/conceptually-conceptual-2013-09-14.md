I had quite an eclectic Friday night, which thankfully for this guy, endeavors into a fit of logical orgasm. Ladies, please, one at a time. OH NO! Young squire, my deary dear! These words are forming into an army of brightly lit tubes, bursting at the seams with pure energy, as they fly past your face into a melted mirage of wonky dreams… sure. The special effects are rather lame, but at least it doesn’t hurt your brain like the mind-bending reality you subscribe to. Dire my description in lust! Okaayyyyy groovy spaceman, what drugs have you been taking within your immediate conception?

As per usual, my opinions have been brutally molested on a whole number of issues, however I don’t doubt their usefulness in molding paradigm. I was blatantly forced into an uncomfortable, yet familiar social situation, which even as the dashing journalist I am, has shaken my senses to the point of agitated tension. Yet in destroying all that is comfortable, I learnt a great deal about the people I fear, though most certainly appreciate. It’s a fine day to be higher consciousness.

In particular, I think I’m a step closer to understanding this concept of love. I think I may have had a gay moment with another guy, my really close friend and it wasn’t something that freaked me. Instead it almost opened my eyes to what true friendship is all about. It was nothing sexual and I don’t think it’ll ever be, because I’m just not that way about guys, but it was certainly love. What we shared was such an open and comfortable notion, that it really changed my mind on the way people express themselves as human beings. Firstly, that the whole notion of gay or straight is a complete crock of shit. Love is love. All you really have are kinks at the end of the day. A foreboding bias to eat away at your sense of being.

Anyway there’s a lot more to talk about, however my phone was totaled last night and so now I need to find a suitable replacement. Pronto. 

Oh, and I’m sorry to all the messages I didn’t get to. I shall do that now :)
