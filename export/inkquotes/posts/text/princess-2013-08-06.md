I want a magical knife to carve the most brilliant princess out of solid gold. She’ll sing, dance and be merry for the rest of time. Never will she be lonely, because gold is the color of desire. Free like the iridescence of her own greatness; pretty and magnificent. 

Frolicking among the stars, shouting into the void. Our princess forever waiting, to the delightful prince untold. All the animals long gone and extinct; the universe your hollow whisper. The distance senses her fate like commons, the speck of dust gleaming violently into love. She waits and waits, decaying into fiber; pain her futile resistance. 

The prince arrives 5 trillion years later, to the speck that he once was. Fragments so far apart, he cries into his heart; the perfection he’ll always want.
