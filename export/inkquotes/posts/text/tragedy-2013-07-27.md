I love the tragedy in people and I really do mean that. I embrace tragedy in every form, I think it’s beautiful; the split-second before a car crash; the burst of chemistry in your heart. Yesterday I got drunk at a friend’s house and we had the most deep session of admittance and honesty. It was so disgusting and horrid, that you honestly wouldn’t have been able to even recognize the denial if it were staring you blank in the face. It certainly wasn’t easy, even for someone like me. 

It was the 4th time we’d met, but you know what? Why do the details matter? To be open and honest is a principle to live by; a reason to die. We both looked each other in the eye and there wasn’t even a hint of shame. Just the glory of confidence, staring back at me. A tear with no purpose.

This is coming from two highly talented comedians. 

I don’t care about your problems, what you do, how you look, your history, your tastes, who you are, the crying, your neurotic tendencies etc. 

I care about YOU.
