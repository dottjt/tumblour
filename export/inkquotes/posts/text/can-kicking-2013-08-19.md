So anyway, I study economic charts and propaganda in my spare time. Well, I used to, up until I realised that it was almost the same shit, every single day. Lies, manipulation and method; the madness we call comfort. Put simply, I was drawn towards finance at a young age, because I wanted to find a way to make money without actually working. I hate work. I mean, I like the physical aspect of lifting boxes and expending energy, however in terms of what humans are capable of, I’d rather study literature or my current passion, aural technique. 

I guess I wanted to be a journalist, however the truth is perhaps THE most frustrating concept to convey. The problem is that there are no universal truths, only selective biases. Humans are awfully selective when it comes to their own beliefs and it drives me insane. The problem is that you CAN convince people to believe in anything, legitimately and without malice. Almost entirely to the point of destruction. No one wins when the critical thinker dies shallow. 

Basically, money makes the world go round, and I mean that in the most literal of senses. You could say that it’s made a cynic out of me, though I’d still like to retain what’s rightfully mine: My insanity. 

Chaos: A higher level of order. The next stage of the economic crash is going to happen very soon, and the average person doesn’t even understand the basic concept of usury, the very basis for capitalism. I guess that’s why we have hierarchy, because we don’t care enough to understand the few universal truths plaguing our paradigm, only a bunch of fantasies we’re perpetuated daily, to keep the few men at the top happy. Democracy truly is a farce when transparency is only a word to be spoken. Though really, this is merely a product of exponential growth. There is no solution. Only a bunch of problems we call humanity.
