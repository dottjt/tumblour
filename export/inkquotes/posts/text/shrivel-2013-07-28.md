You terrible fiend, like dirt in my nails, discard and digress, we shall not distress. Help is your life, the rope you don’t have. How can you suffer when perception hath wings? Fly to your summer, winter untold. Will not Shall not Can not. You’re failure with a name, the name of your words.

When thus falls upon you, upon the face you don’t own, when it crumbles like candy, into the pot of your gold. Don’t be so foolish, stupid like ice, broken and shattered, the farce of your life. Let it burn… let it burn to your soul.

The fire is your light. Touch it and die.

Live it all summer, dream all your life.
