I’ve kinda been feeling a little ‘on edge’ lately, because of certain individuals within my life. Yet when I actually look at my life for what it is, the whole thing is quite remarkable. I have a bunch of people I can rely on to call my friends, there’s still a significant chance that I’m going to get laid and there’s plenty of ideas and notions to keep me preoccupied. 

As of late, I’ve generally been treating life as a somewhat tiresome burden, but it doesn’t really matter if it is or if it’s not. I still have another 60+ years left in me and it’s the best feeling in the world, to know that this is simply the beginning and that even if I’m a failure now, it won’t matter because success is simply a matter of living against time’s will. There’s nothing inherently wrong with taking it slow. It’s almost preferred. May as well; it’s not like I’m going to be missing out on these things later on in life. Most people get burnt out by their midlife/senior years, but the way I see it, is that I’ve got a heap more living left to do. It’s about quantity, because we’re always going to bitch about quality, one way or another. There’s only so many things one can do again and again, before it becomes a matter of routine. Control the quantity dear and you’ll be right love.

There’s no reason to be anxious, to be scared, to be down. Life is good because it’s shit. We can all be happy, all it really takes is an over-dose of perspective and the world is ours. I take comfort in variety, the idea that we experience a bit of everything. Imagine people who never experience depression or frequent bouts of mania? Imagine how shallow their existence really is, when they can only call one face home? Give me a smile. I promise it won’t be your last.
