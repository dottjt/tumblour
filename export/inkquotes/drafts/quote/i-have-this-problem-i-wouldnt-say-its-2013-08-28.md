I have this problem. I wouldn’t say it’s particularly problematic, however it’s certainly a hinder to the 21st century lifestyle. Put simply, I struggle with escaping reality.

Some people want to escape their own life, but not me. I think life is too great to leave, too great to manifest into a bunch of dreams. At the very least, I can get absorbed into a book, which I often do frequently. It’s just that I don’t see the point in being something else that is vastly exaggerated from the norm.

At it’s essence, grammar is really just an extension of complex logic, 

Interestly wierd people I can understand. We’re dealing with tragedy here. But cosplay n’ all that? I don’t get it. I mean, I really do appreciate it and it’s something I wish I did get, but I just don’t.
