It sucks. I’ve been rejected by every single girl I’ve approached in real life. Hilariously, I don’t actually mind being rejected, because randomly asking a girl out is possibly the most hopeless and stupid thing anyone can do. You know it’s going to fail miserably, yet you go in for the kill, only to find your have murdered your ego, now lying there dead, in the arms of the girl you attempted to woo. The more awkward, the better. I like to laugh at life and bitch about the stupid things, hence my reason for existing. Nothing really gets me down, no matter how bad the experience. I just laugh at how stupid the whole thing is and promptly move on.

I mean, as it is, it’s fucking retarded to just approach a woman in public, out of nowhere, to actually convince them to somehow go on a date with you. How do you even start the whole thing? You see, the problem with being a guy, is that no matter what you say, she’s going to automatically think: “Yep. He’s trying to get in my pants.” which is so incredibly fucking true. So then the whole point is to be subtle about the whole thing, which I cannot do, because I’m a complete idiot. I’m not interested in caressing you with my words. I just want to stick my face firmly inbetween your breasts while 

Both times I’ve done it, it was possibly the worst case scenario to any extent. So the first time was this girl I had a MASSIVE crush on, who used to take the same tram home that I did from school. I honestly thought she was an angel and possibly the most attractive girl I’ve ever seen. Well, maybe not. I’ve sort of realised that everyone is just attractive for different reasons. She had the most amazing blush and her face… wow.
