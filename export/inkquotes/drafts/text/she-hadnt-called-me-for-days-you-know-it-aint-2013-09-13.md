She hadn’t called me for days. You know, it ain’t the rejection filling the tank of my eternal darkness. This damn phone is killin’ me. Look at it sitting there, projecting the hidiousness of it’s soul like a broadcast to the brainwashed masses. Hitler was right. You can do anything with a bunch of stupidity. Need I not look any further than the mirror on my desk. Seven years bad luck it is.
