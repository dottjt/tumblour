You may break me down. You may take my soul and sell it to the highest bidder; a man with no morals but his own. Grope the deprivation flowing from my thighs, as it pours down your throat into your suffocating traverse of your lungs.

But you may never take my imagination. Even if it kills you to see me run free.
