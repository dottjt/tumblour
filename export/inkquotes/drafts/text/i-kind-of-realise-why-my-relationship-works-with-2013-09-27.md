I kind of realise why my relationship works with my girlfriend. It’s because we’re both romantics who are in-love with words. There’s something about words that can convey meaning in such a complex way, that chat simply cannot. 

With words, you are not restricted by context. You can be romantic, you can be cheeky, you can be anything. It’s as conceptual and silly as that pig, currently flying past my windor. When you’re talking to someone on the other hand, you feel restricted by reality.
