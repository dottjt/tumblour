There’s a lot to hate about me. When I think about it, I’m unbearble in my natural state, which would explain my many tainted friendships. You’ll either hate my honesty or think I take our relationship too seriously. I don’t think I can ever just ‘be’, because I don’t like leaving things to chance. I guess it’s good and bad thing, though personally I think it’s more of a positive. If not that, I’ll either hate you because I won’t like who you are, or because I understand you too well and your personality gives me the shits. 

I mean, I’m generally an accepting person. It’s just that it takes two to tango. 

Generally, my best friends can be defined as the bunch of fellows who aren’t easily offended by my antics and have the same intellectual and emotional depth as me, though . Don’t get me wrong, I’m incredibly sensitive and emotional, but I don’t find it difficult to distinguish between complete mallice and benign innocence. Don’t let the arrogance seep through. 

Now this can either mean one of two things. That we both have no opinions to honestly give a shit about or that we’re both unaffected by the abuse. 

That’s kinda what makes me difficult with women, because I say things that are true, but things that are generally taken for granted. It’s not that I want to offend you, it’s that I just want to be open.
