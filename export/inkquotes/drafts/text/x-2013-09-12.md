I don’t know why girls wear makeup. I’m not stupid. The first thing I always do when I meet a person, is I read their face for cues to their personality. I personally enjoy trying to imagine what people would look like without makeup on. I love to see what people are truly like, minus the sugar coated perception. That’s why I like to ask questions: I want to get to know the person behind the mask, not the fool in front of the screen. 

I believe I objectify women, just as much as they objectify me. I dress horribly and people give me some pretty seedy looks, as if I’m this homeless piece of crap. Well gee, fair enough. I’m totally cool with that, I really don’t care what others think of me. So naturally, I’m going to comment on other women.
