I don’t know what it is, but I want to be cute. Don’t get me wrong, I love pussy n’ beating off to women, but for some reason, I just want to be kinda… girlish? The way I act, my vaguely flamboyant mannerisms, the understanding, the emotion. Though it’s very subtle, I very much play the guy. I think it’s just because I’m soft, though really, it’s ambiguous at best. My predominant talent, is that I can take any form and please even the most vain of people. 

Predominant wit is such a great talent, because it allows you to study and play characters. I can get along with pretty much anyone, even complete pricks. It’s about gaining their trust and giving them the illusion that they have the advantage. Play the stoopid. I guess that’s the talent of the journalist: The ability to be empathetic and be compassionate. 

Some call it manipulation. I’ll pay that. It beats rejecting society for the shambles it is.
