I somehow managed to come across the Tumblr profile of the girl in high school, whom I used to have the biggest crush on. Oh please, it’s not any of you guys :p In fact, she never really knew me and I she didn’t really know me. We were just two kids on a tram. I actually find it really odd whenever I find someone’s profile whom I know in real life, because it’s that awkward moment where you get an insight into who they’re like as a person. Thankfully my profile is anonymous.
