She was the first girl I’d kinda ever thought I had a chance with and it was a complete disaster. She actually turned me off women for a very long and in a sense, it destroyed my mindset of what women should be. It’s not like she was an inherently bad person or that she was even conscious of who she was, but it was a very perverse situation that ended up in the a lonely sense of being.

Here’s the thing: It was my second semester of university and by then, I hadn’t gotten anything from the ordeal. I’d just lost my best friend over a feud and in fact, I hadn’t made any new friends at all. I just plain hated the experience. I thought it was a colossal waste of time. I think there may have been a couple of girls I clicked with, but it was just awkward in class and when you don’t have a job or any money, it becomes even more of a struggle to do anything even remotely quaint. So come second semester and I’m like “Fuck, this is gonna be so shit.” Anyway, I rock up to my language class and at some point, this extraordinarily cute girl turns up and sits next to me. 

Now I’m good at flirting as it’s pretty much the only thing I’m good at with women. I’m terrible at making a move because I’m too nervous and I have no idea what the hell I’m doing.
