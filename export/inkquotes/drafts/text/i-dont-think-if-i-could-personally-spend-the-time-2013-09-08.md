I don’t think if I could personally spend the time to do a picture blog, though I’d know what I’d have to do to make it successful. On another note, I’ve always wanted to do a Tumblr posed as a cute girl, just to see how I’d be treated differently, but you know, there are more pressing things to do with my time. 

The great thing about pictures is that they give meaning via association and branding. If you reblog a picture about the Simpsons, usually that’s a reference to nostalgia and oh hey look! I grew up in the 90’s too! We have something in common! Pictures are simple, though easily abused. It doesn’t require any talent to post a picture or to make an association, so there’s very little actual value to conceive at a raw level. 

The difference i’m referring to is style over substance. Everyone has a sense of style and Tumblr is easily abused in that way, because style is subjective and purely interpretative. However 

The reason why I love words, is that they’re ultimately limitless in your purpose and the challenge is in seeking this very purpose. I mean, yes you can write a fake account of how you fucked a super model and how it was the most steamy thing ever, however the importance is the words came from within, whereas a picture is generally a representation of your the outside world: Not yourself.
