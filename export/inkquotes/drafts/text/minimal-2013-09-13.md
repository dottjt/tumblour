I’m a philosophical minimalist and it’s so incredibly hard to get bitches, because ultimately you need to have something, in order to get something. 

- I don’t buy or wear any fancy clothes. 

- I don’t watch TV, I don’t watch any shows, I don’t watch movies. I really don’t seem to consume any media at all. 

- I generally don’t spend my money. Groceries and for when I go out and hang with friends, but other than that, the rest is saved.
