Hi. I’m a girl. Please don’t rape me or anything. I hate getting raped, it’s a lot like eating pizza. It’s not something that’s particularly enjoyable, but it’s pizza, so you don’t really have a choice. Everyone loves pizza, but not bad pizza.

Most people are probably going to be mad at what I say and that’s not to say I agree with what it is, it’s just my interpretation. In some ways, I think rape is a form of male expression. Sure, not a good form of expression, but I do believe for some individuals it’s a way of expressing themselves.
