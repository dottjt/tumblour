Two schools of thought - cute vs hot. 

I find hot people deliriously lame, though I think we all do it. I think it’s probably why I bring my Korean friend with me when I go out. He has no expressionable personality, has a terrible way of talking, isn’t particularly interesting or self-aware , though he’s very open-minded and lax. I tell him all these things all the time and he knows it, but it’s kinda hard when you’ve been in study asian mode for the best part of your entire life.
