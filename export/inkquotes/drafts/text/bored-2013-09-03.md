I feel incredibly bored with my life. I almost feel like I’ve achieved everything I want to. 

I’ve done absolutely everything I’ve wanted to, I’ve fulfilled my media . I feel like I no longer have purpose. 

I think the last thing that’s left is for me to have a girlfriend, though I’m honestly unsure if that’s what I ultimately want. I know I’d love it, but is it really what I want? Rather, what choice do I really have?

That’s honestly the one thing I hate about Tumblr. It’s almost as if you’re basically saying, well I’ve given up on life. Let’s just talk about it instead. 

The difficulty with capitalism, is in trying to add value, to what is already a developed society. Further more, in adding value that people want. 

Here’s the thing: I have so many great ideas that would improve people’s lives. The only problem is that a) There’s no money in what is essentially social charity and b) People don’t care about improving their lives, at least because the very idea is subjective at it’s core.
