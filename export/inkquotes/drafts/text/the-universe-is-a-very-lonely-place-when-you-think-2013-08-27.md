The universe is a very lonely place when you think about it. All you really have is your own consciousness. Everything else is merely external, or an extension that experience. That’s why people make us so happy, because in a sense, they can relate to what we have. They understand our pain, they go through the same thing, they just ‘get’ being human, because that is what they are. Yet this still doesn’t negate the fact that we are only one mind. One soul. One irreplaceable perspective on this horizon of sensory deprivation.
