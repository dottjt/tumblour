Everything’s OK now. I’ve sorted it out with her. She still means the world to me. 

To be honest, I never really felt that way about her. Even once I found out, I still loved her just as my much. 

I didn’t really mean any of those hateful things about her. I’m just a writer, it’s what I do. An opportunist, if you will.
