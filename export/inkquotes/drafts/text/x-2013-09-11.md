Ideally you’d have to find a girl who’s equally as desperate as the man standing in the mirror. I kind of think it as a jigsaw piece. She needs to be different to the point of curiosity, yet intellectually relatable. Already, I have no chance. 

I guess it’d need to be someone highly irrational, though knowingly so. Fun, but off their tits fun. Of course, I wouldn’t really have anything of the sort to offer her. I’d just be that boring ol’ thinking in the background, wishing to have a lone stranger come out of the bushes to blow my brain out. Beats the hell out of premarital sex. Anything leading up to d-day, really must be nervous as tinkering with a delicate time bomb. At least you can know your cigarette was a smooth one indeed. I couldn’t think of anything better to go with death.
