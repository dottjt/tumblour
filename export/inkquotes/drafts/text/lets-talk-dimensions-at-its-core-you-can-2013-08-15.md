Let’s talk dimensions. At it’s core, you can really just simplify everything down into one dimension. So you have this line and it either goes up or down. For some reason, this line has direction, however it still has equilibrium. It may be heading up, and it may be heading down, however it’s direction never changes. 

Life is the direction that you seek and although you have no control. 

You are a waveform.
