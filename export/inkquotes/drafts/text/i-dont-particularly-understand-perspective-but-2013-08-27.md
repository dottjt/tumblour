I don’t particularly understand perspective, but it does seem to enjoy acting like a massive cunt at times. I don’t what it is, but you temperament will do a complete 180 and you’ll like dirt. 

Is it that you become so happy, that your body needs equalise? Perhaps you discover so many things about yourself that make you happy, that you run out of potential things that make you happy and it drowns you out silly?
