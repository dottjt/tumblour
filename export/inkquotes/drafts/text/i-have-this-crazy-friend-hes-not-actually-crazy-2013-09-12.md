I have this crazy friend. He’s not actually crazy. He’s just perfectly insane, which really is a form of desirable insanity. Everything is just a spectrum, much like a waveform and no matter what, there will always be some sort of motion to dictate the way we exist. Agitation. Heat. Anger.

No one knows anything, not even the matrix itself. The pointless of existence is just perpetuated by nothing but existence itself, by the vision of our uncertain reality, because by golly gosh, nothing is real. Only the tape of your consciousness, forever dictated by the chemistry in your heart. This is the general gist of how our conversations go.

He’s experienced a lot in life.
