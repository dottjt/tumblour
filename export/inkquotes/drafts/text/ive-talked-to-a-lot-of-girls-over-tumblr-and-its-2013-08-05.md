I’ve talked to a lot of girls over Tumblr and it’s not something I particularly brag about. It just is what it is. I enjoy getting to know people, and so it may as well be the opposite sex. While I’ve met a lot of nice people, there’s only one girl who’s made me feel special.

I think it’s because she’s straight forward and she’s willing to share anything. Most girls shy away or get defensive, and that’s when I know it’s not worth the effort. I can’t tell you how much easier it is when they have no shame. If it’s gonna be difficult, I’m just not going to bother. 

Tumblr is one big tease, which is why I’ve realised how stupid the whole thing is.
