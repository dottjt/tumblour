I don’t know why girls bitch about not being able to find a guy. All you literally have to do is open your mouth, and we’ll come running within an instant to wipe the spit from your cheek. Actually say hello. Introduce yourself. Put in some fucking effort, instead of expecting prince charming to come to your rescue. You want to talk about real equality, start acting like a human being, not a princess.

You couldn’t possibly understand how impossible it is for a guy. Guys aren’t entirely stupid. We know girls are just as horny, if not more horny than guys. It’s a human thing. But unless if you act like an equal human being, it’s going to be massively difficult for everyone. So you don’t want a relationship? That’s OK. We’re honestly not fussed by that (yes, some guys are obviously retarded). But if you are actually interested, then at least show it. 

Dare I say we prefer sluts. If you’re a smart slut. Yes. We love that. If you’re just a dumb slut, which almost seems to be the generic stereotype, then please fuck off. You are of no value, just like with sleazy guys who have a dick for a brain.
