I’m not particularly ashamed of how I look. Long before I joined Tumblr, I was doing a lot YouTube comedy. Generally making a complete fool of myself on camera. 

I think the reason why I don’t show my face, is because I don’t want to place an emphasis on how I look. I’d rather people pay attention to my words.
