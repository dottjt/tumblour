The more I talk to her, the more I realise that I will probably never find another girl like her in my entire life. When I say she’s perfect, I don’t just mean that figuratively. I mean that literally.

There’s really just too much to love about her. I generally find most women obnoxious or inevitably I’ll find some small detail to hate about them, but at no point have I ever doubted her ability to be amazing. Some girls are too insecure, some girls are too dumb, others aren’t compassionate enough and it even may be a case that you’re both amazing people, but you’re just not ready nor right for each other. 

I naturally loath people. I think that must be understood. 

She gets it when I talk politics. She doesn’t think I’m entirely crazy, even though I may very well be. I’m a good person who cares, that’s really what matters at the end of the day. What excites me the most however, is the fact that we’re both inherently romantics. Generally we masturbate to each other over Skype and it’s even better when there are no visuals.
