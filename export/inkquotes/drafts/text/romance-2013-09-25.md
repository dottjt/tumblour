Part of me feels that romance is dishonest and fair to say, I would think that it is to some extent.

When you think about it, I’ve managed, as she has, to completely place each other into a complete state of passion and excitement over …wait for it.

A bunch of words.

Which really confirms that love is a form of communication. 

I guess that’s why it helps to be a writer as well as journalist. In fact, I think it's what makes for good romance. To be able to effectively communicate a bunch of ideas that will have them wetter than a fish underwater. Sweet message, dumb blonde. You make the manipulation of my soul much, much too easy.
