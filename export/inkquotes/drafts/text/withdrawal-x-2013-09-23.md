Let’s talk about the dark side to being so passionately in-love. Love is one hell of a drug and let me reassure you, the withdrawals are like nothing I’ve ever experienced before. You think it’s hard giving up crack cocaine? tut tut. Wait till you inject a heavy dose of “love” into those weak little veins of yours. 

When I say I want her more than anything in the world, I really do meant that. I don’t know how many times I have to say it. I didn’t even buy GTA5 because of her and you must understand, as an avid GTA fan since day one, as someone who idolised the series since I was a small child, even THAT doesn’t bother me at this stage. I’ve been waiting years for this game to come out and yet here I stand, dedicated to something greater and we’ve barely been together for a week.

Our meeting up on the 26th of October is comparable to a small child anxiously waiting for Christmas. Except a) You know that you’re going to be getting the most fantastic present of all-time and b) You’ll be meeting Santa himself. Though for me, I don’t ever remember being this excited about Christmas; knowing that it was complete bullshit from day one. Instead, our coming together is our religious festival, which is many times better than some sort of false imagination perpetuated by consumerism.

Our love feels comparable to a heroin addiction, not that I’d actually know. All that’s apparent is that I’m desperate for my next fix: she’s literally all I can think about. Though what’s really screwing with us, is the fact that we both decided to go cold-turkey and limit our transactions to an hour a day. Terrible idea. All we can think about is each other. We can’t even concentrate on our daily lives, and every living moment not spent together feels like a regret. 

Our attachment is actually quite logical, considering how our relationship has progressed. Basically what’s been happening, is that we’ve been talking to each other constantly and because we get along so well, the more we talked, the more we liked each other and the more attached we became. As the attachment grew, the time spent talking to each other also increased, to the point where we’d talk to each other at any given moment we had. The only requirement was participation; just as I said from the very beginning. 

So here we are, so crazily in-love that it hurts to know we live so far apart from each other. However like all dopamine reactions, we need more and more interaction to keep the buzz going. So not only have we limited our time with each other, but the very fact that we can’t yet experience our touch, has further driven us to insanity. It kinda sucks to be such a hopeless romantic in this situation, yet at the same time, it’s all a simple matter of perspective. 

People would do unspeakable-th to experience the kind of excitement and enthusiasm I’m currently living through. This is literally the exact opposite to depression. This is when you have so much passion and attachment towards life, that it hurts to know you that it’s all in your head; just like your depression. It isn’t something to be feared or worried about it. It’s something to be cherished and embraced. How many people can wake up each day, knowing exactly what they want and how they want to feel? That’s the kind of girl I’ve got. 

These feelings aren’t to be confused for something negative. This is to be seen as the greatest sensation that life has to offer. Just because the truth hurts, doesn’t make it any less significant. It may be too much to handle, but it’s not like you can have too much of a good thing, compared to too much of a bad thing. Think positive. Even if it’s so overwhelming that it crushes you. 

It’s kind of funny, because when I think about people who have casual sex, I can only imagine how much less of an experience that is, say compared to mine. Sex is obviously great, but when any activity for that matter, is purely out of intense love, it just enhances the experience so much more. It’s sort of like those people who’ve played music since they were 4-years-old and all they want to do at 60, is play even more music. It means so much more to then, than the typical person. 

Even though it’s been roughly 3 weeks since we first spoke over Skype, it honestly feels like we’ve been together since the dawn of time. Love doesn’t care about boundaries. It only seeks comfort in your other-half. Fair to say, It’s the most unbearable, amazing feeling in the whole entire world. 

Talk about dopamine response. Wait till we fuck while ON drugs. I promise that LSD sex will best the most magical experience of our lives. I can’t even imagine the orgasm, but I suspect it will be greater than life itself. It certainly was alone, without passion and to some petty porn. In fact, I was only listening to music with headphones and it honestly felt like my brain was about to explode from the orgasm from a bunch of sound-waves bombarding my ears.

My future is dying to meet it’s present.
