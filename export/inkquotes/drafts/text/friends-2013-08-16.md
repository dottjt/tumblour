Sometimes I forget how many friends I truly have. There are so many people I can rely on, so many friend groups to cherish and explore, so much of everything in my life. I feel like I have too much to do, too much purpose to seek. It overwhelms you and confuses the intention in your heart. Yes, which one? 

I think it’s because I appreciate everything for what it is. There’s no one experience that I inherently dislike, because I treat it all as one big learning tool. Perspective is like a play-dough with infinite uses. 

I honestly hate this optimist rhetoric. I think it’s pretentious and lame. It’s what I aim to avoid, yet I don’t know why. It’s useful arrogance.
