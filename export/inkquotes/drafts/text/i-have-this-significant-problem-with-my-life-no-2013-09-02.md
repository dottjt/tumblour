I have this significant problem with my life. No matter what, I just don’t feel adequate with what I have. It’s funny, because the whole idea of this “going out” thing is to meet new people and have a good time, but I forget that I already have a strong set of supportive and desirable friends. Yet for some reason, I cannot see that.
