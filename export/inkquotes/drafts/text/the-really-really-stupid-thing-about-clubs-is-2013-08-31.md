The really, really stupid thing about clubs, is the very fact that it almost suggests this notion that, this is the very best we could come up with. That the club is supposedly the very pinnacle of the socialising experience, despite it’s imperfections. It’s almost depressing to think about. 

What I realised from that night, is that it ultimately comes down to what you value the most in your life.
