Women aren’t that difficult. All you have to do is play a bunch of mind games, post a couple of cute selfies, don’t seem like a complete prick and wala! You’ll still find yourself single.

I don’t really think it’s important whether you’re in a relationship or not. I mean, obviously it would be amazing to have someone to live, but when you consider that you’ve most likely spent a great portion of your life alone.

In fact, once you consider that we’re all ultimately alone in the over scheme of our own bloated ego, you realise that there’s very little to be afraid of.
