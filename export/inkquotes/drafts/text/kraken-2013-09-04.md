I hate influencing opinion, which is actually kind of funny. Because the more you know, the less you want to tell. At least, it’s out of fear for your own ego. Then it becomes a matter of concept. Then it becomes a matter of acceptance. Very few people know what’s truly going on, because very few people have the all-round perspective to seek the correct knowledge.

Most people are absorbed within this left-right paradigm. 

That’s why I like the idea of free thinking.
