There is no real sense of individuality in this world of doublespeak, only mere illusions to fester the deconstructed mind. I’m honestly not convinced that humans even want to be different, we’re just particular about our arrogance. When we speak of love, we really mean love, for aren’t they both two sides of the same coin?

I find it funny, because I spend my entirely life trying to be different, when really I’m just common, which then confuses you about your own intentions in life.
