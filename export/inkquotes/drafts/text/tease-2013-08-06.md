Before joining Tumblr, I was honestly convinced that most guys were retarded. Now I realise that most girls are too. I think the two main problems is that girls over-estimate their significance, whereas guys play the sucker in every situation.

I’ve come to notice that girls are horrible at tease. They think it’s all about smutty pictures and insinuations, but girls aren’t THAT smart. They think they’ve got ‘it’, but it’s this exact arrogance of assuming that anyone has 'it’, which kills everything. No one has 'it’, because 'it’ needs to be created first. 

So when girls tease half the time, it really just serves as a backhand against their own face, and you honestly wonder why most girls are depressed and insecure. One in four U.S. women on psych meds, you heard it here first. It confuses them more than it does us. At the same time, guys don’t really know what they’re doing, we’re not smart enough for that either. 

Fuck em’ both to hell.
