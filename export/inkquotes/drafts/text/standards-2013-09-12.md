I don’t like this double standard here on Tumblr. On the one hand, girls post all these sexy pictures, girls with perfect bodies, which you know, I’m totally fine with. Fair enough, that isn’t what bothers me. It’s that afterwards, you have people that then preach about “positive” body image and that’s when everything falls flat on their face. Girls then get depressed over how they look and it’s kinda like, well gee, you don’t really expect to possibly have both, do you? You can worship an ideal, one simple perspective, then expect people to be open minded about themselves.

My basic argument is that there’s no such thing as equality, otherwise we would be having this discussion and that in the pursuit for equality, all you really do is emphasize the inequality, not actually aim to solve it. I get it, equality is a noble quest, but it’s like playing with explosives. The end outcome is nil. 

Some people are just better at some things. It’s a simple fact of life. My penis ain’t that big. I can’t help it. I maintain that there’s no equality when it comes to body image, though that isn’t the issue. All I ask is that people take a side, then move on: Either worship bodies for what they are (yes, completely subjective. If you think fat chicks are hot, by all means worship that) and accept that inequality is inherent, or just stop this farce altogether and maintain that everyone is the same for reasons X, Y and Z. Good luck with that.

Though the deeper question that boggles me, is why we even focus on body image in the first place? This relates more to the human psyche and why people bother to take notice to how others look. Personally speaking, I don’t care. Sure. I understand that some people are more attractive, though as a whole, I think everyone is grotesque: It’s simply a matter of perception. 

Furthermore, why is it that people need to inherently “feel good” about their body image? Why can’t they feel good about personality or something a little less shallow? I understand that we talk about choice in society. I get that, but surely people can see the danger in making certain choices? Problems are created from within, not from outside. Illness is a sickness. It’s a choice that denial seeks to overcome. 

We talk about “positive” body image, but you know what? Fuck body image as a whole. You’re playing with perception here and I can’t stand the politics in people. Why put on makeup to make yourself seem prettier. What could you possibly aim to achieve, that cannot be promoted in a more positive fashion? So you want guys to fuck you. Fair enough. 

It’s purely a mentality thing. I mean, put it this way. I work out, I’ve got a vague six pack going on, I look fit and muscular. But you know what? I don’t look at myself in the mirror naked and I could honestly give two shits how I look. I’m doing it for the health benefits and nothing more. I wear these horribly baggy clothes that give zero emphasis to how I look and quite frankly I look like dirt when I go out. Though you know what, I just don’t care. I’m still going to treat everyone with the same amount of respect. Why are people so obsessed with other people’s standards, when they should be concerned with themselves?
