I’ve always thought killing oneself was a noble act indeed. Cruel and unforgiving, but vain courage at it’s core. Suicide is the ultimate vanity of control. You choose, you decided, you die. To this day, I’ve never understood people who say it’s cowardice to put a bullet in it all. Unfortunately, most people kill themselves out of fear, not for the very reasons that makes it so great.

Suicide is the ultimate act of sacrifice, though possibly foolishness. I would argue that the foolishness is what makes it so To end a life is really to .

Yet it’s simply a matter of perspective and living beings have exactly zero perspective on life.
