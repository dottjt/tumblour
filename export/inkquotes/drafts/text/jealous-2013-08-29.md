I am crippled by my own jealousy of others. But alas, that is incorrect. I am not so greedy and fatalistic in my approach towards perfection. 

My solution thus far, has been to move on quickly. I see no solution to a sickness, so all you really have is acceptance and I am very good at accepting my own fate.
