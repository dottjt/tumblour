I’m the kind of person who fiercely rejects popular culture. Whenever I see a popular YouTube video, I run like the plague. It’s all perception and nothing more. I mean, you do realise there’s an infinite amount of ideas, yet you’re selectively narrowing yourself down.

You know those amazing feelings you get from watching a really funny YouTube video with more than 5 millions views? Yep. They’re not real as well, even though you can FEEL it. You’re surrounding yourself in comfort dear. Are your own ideas not enough to keep you sane? 

That’s why I can’t stand people obsessed with certain facets of life. Music, TV shows, theater etc. You’re giving power to hierarchy. You’re giving power to ideas you fool. 

You know, if everyone believed that suicide was the best way to live their life, as of midnight tonight, everyone would be dead overnight? A very simple idea, though let’s not get too carried away by the sentiment. Don’t let your beliefs dictate how you feel. Let’s siphon off your of imagination of yours to your own realm of greater appreciation. 

Sure. It’s all bullshit and a colossal waste of our time, but it is what it is. So you’re a sucker for branding and marketing, which is why you cannot see straight. You’re trying to beat your own perception down, with an even heftier dose of perception. Oh please.

If I market myself to be a fairy, then that’s what this fairy shall be.

What people don’t seem to realise is that they’re being sold ideas and for some reason, people make associations in their head that certain ideas are better than others. Yet what’s even disturbing, is how in our consumerist culture, people are so willing to have ideas sold to them. 

They’re really not. 

I mean, I live quite a subservient existence. I don’t really spend much of my money, but I tell ya what, I’m incredibly happy with who I am.
