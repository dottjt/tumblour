I feel that there’s almost too much to do. Too much to experience, too much to see. I think that’s what convinces me to wake up in the morning. Just knowing that there’s so much potential in my actions, if not personally for myself. 

Yet I’m completely torn in my life. The choice has rendered me useless. In the search for meaning, you inadvertently do what you love. You follow your heart to the land of dreams, a realm of regret free sentiment. But along the way, you see people dying, suffering in pain, followed by hardship and you admittedly question your own set of morals. How can you be so selfish? How can you be so brilliant, yet wasteful.
