People probably think I’m weird, desperate at a minimum, but I really don’t care. I know who I am, however do you really know who you are? We seem to have a lot of shame in society and it’s a killer of attitude. Anyone who reads anything from face value should have a good hard look at themselves, not that they’d be able to get past the denial. 

Shame to reveal their emotions. Shame to seem weak. Shame to be loved. People are generally afraid, not of others, but of themselves. They look into their souls and they don’t like what they see. So they create a social standard to protect themselves from their own thoughts. Never in my lifetime. 

Perception is bullshit and it only takes a second to realise that illusion is that game we play. People are shameful because they cannot handle themselves. So much for self-discovery. Good luck walking yourself into endless circles of madness; the story of your life.
