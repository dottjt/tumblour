I’m not a big spender. I don’t spend my money on much. I’m saving it all and investing it into a certain class of asset, so that I can profit from the up-and-coming economic crash. I’m actually planning on becoming part of the new economic elite, though you don’t need to know that. There’s a reason why this blog is partially anonymous ;) 

I pay for groceries, drugs, and dates. That’s all you really need in life. My friends provide the rest. I actually have this indecent obsession, where I walk through the supermarket and compare food prices. In my defense, I’m like 2 minutes away, so fuck you. 

You’d be surprised what you’re paying for
