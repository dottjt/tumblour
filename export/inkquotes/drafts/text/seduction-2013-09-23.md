I remember reading a few books on seduction and I now find the whole thing hilarious. I mean, they’re extraordinarily helpful when it comes to understanding human psychology, though in the overall scheme of things, all I really had to do was be myself. 

Seduction is basically playing around with people’s wants and needs. It also implies that you don’t have the wants and needs of the other person, which is why you must conjure and manipulate them into a sense of self-comfort. The funny thing is that all you really have to do to get a girlfriend, is simply be yourself.

You see the problem most people have, is that they want to please everyone. When people have been alone for so long, they get desperate and they’re willing to do anything to get another person. They feel that by being themselves, they’re in fact limiting their chances, which when you think about it, is the entire point of being yourself.

You see those hilariously generic girls on Facebook, who have the same generic personality, the same generic photos at clubs, the same generic smile and it’s kind of like… who exactly are you trying to impress here, because it feels like you’re impressing no one but yourself.

Quite obviously they’re insecure about their own prospects, which is why they’re still inherently single. Then once they do find a guy who buys into the flashy colors, he slowly begins to loath her neurotic behaviour and then they break up, in what couldn’t have been a more typical relationship. Some people just should be in a relationship, because they’re just not ready. You can want a guy so bad, but unless if you’re happy with yourself, you’re just another lost soul in a world of confusion. 

I think seduction is a good way of understanding yourself, however one thing I realised is that I’m naturally seductive and that it’s simply a matter of practice. My friend who studied it way further than I did, would always tell me how I’d say certain things to people to get a certain reaction, yet it’s not something I’d realise because it would be subconscious. 

Though it’s a very complex topic. Let’s leave it at that.
