I’m never going to get laid again. I just don’t see how it’s ever going to happen. 

I’m never going to find a girl who I can relate to. Sure, someone who’s nice, but never someone who can actually relate to my concerns. They just won’t “get it”.

So then you’re stuck finding a girl who’s just nice and caring, which I guess is all you can really go for. Though surely the whole thing then becomes shallow?
