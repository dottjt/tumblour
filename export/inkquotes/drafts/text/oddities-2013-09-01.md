A few other oddities approached my night. I saw a guy get the absolute shit kicked out of him, right in front of where I was sitting on the train, but let’s start from the beginning. 

So me and my friend leave this rave at around 1:30am and we’re dying for some food, so we go to subway, because it was the only reasonable place open and I hadn’t been there since I was like 12, so I thought, what the hell. Anyway, so I’m talking to the guy who works there, this 23 year old Indian man, and his story was almost typical. He works night shifts for $15 an hour, has a second job at Mcdonalds, lives in point cook (mind you, we were in South Yarra), while studying for his masters in IT. I think the general idea is that by befriending him, he’d give us some free food. No chance there. 

We were contemplating catching a taxi, since trains don’t operate so deliriously late at night, but it turned out it’d cost $50, so we thought fuck it, we’ll just spend the next 4 hours walking towards the city.
