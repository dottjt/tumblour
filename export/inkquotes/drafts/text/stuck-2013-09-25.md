I keep writing these posts about love, my girlfriend etc. since that really is that basis of my life. But I refuse to post them because I now realise that the whole thing is so stupid. Love, like any emotion, is something that you must experienced to be believed. It is not a play thing. It is a force of nature.

That’s why I believe so many people are depressed. They forget what these emotions feel like. It’s why happy people crave depression, because they forget the feel of deprivation wrapped tremmor.

So while I can express my love and tell you what it feels like, it can only frustrate you and turn to jealously, if you cannot relate to the very words I perpetutate. I can tell, but I cannot touch. 

Either that, or I’ll write a long post that needs to be edited, but I won’t have time, so I leave it till later. Then once the time comes, my feelings have changed and the post will no longer be relevant.

Maybe for a rainy day. We’ll see.
