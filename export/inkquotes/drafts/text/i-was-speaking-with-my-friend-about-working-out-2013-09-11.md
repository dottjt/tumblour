I was speaking with my friend about working out again. I’d kinda stopped after a fairly good streak. Prior to that, I was having difficulty with my aspirations following the paleo diet. That fucker is hard, but the benefits were just insane. Zero sleepiness and you feel amazing, all the time. What I’ve learnt from my efforts, is that everything is a long term effort and that even if you fail now, as long as you have your heart in the right place, you’ll eventually be consistent with your goals.

I must admit that I’m a bit of a life hack maniac. I biphasic sleep, meaning I have an hour and a half nap during the day, then I only sleep four and a half hours at night and now I can’t go back. You only need to sleep six hours a day, so that you have so much time to do all the other stuff you love, assuming you don’t hate life as much as the people on Tumblr make it out to seem. Not to mention, you don’t feel tired before bed and no shit, you don’t feel drowsy when you wake up. It’s bam and you’re up and ready to hug the world with your brimming energy. 

The paleo diet is hard for a number of reasons, though it’s simply about adjusting. Firstly it’s no grain and low carb (with the exception of vegetables, not so much fruit). Grains are basically bad for your body, but there’s a million arguments why. Secondly, you want to get a majority of your energy from fat, then secondly protein. Contrary to popular belief, saturated fat is good for you. It’s actually impossible to put on fat by eating fat, you only put on fat by eating carbs. People are easily misled, though that doesn’t concern me because I do my research ^^. 

Fuck. I’ve spent months studying this thing and I could rant on for hours about how traditional diets are a hunk of crap and the whole perception of weight loss and why most people fail or have a hard time. It’s actually really, really easy and pain free if you just use your brain for a squidge of a second. Anyway, so I was talking to my friend about working out and I asked him how he’d been so consistent with his work outs. I would do these 10 week plans and I’d get roughly 5-6 weeks in, before giving up entirely. Once you get to that level of fitness, you really just don’t see the point to any of it again. 

Discipline. He said discipline and without even knowing it, my whole perception on life changed. It really was as simple as a word. I began studying everything to do with discipline and now I’m back on board with everything. I’ve started doing my uni work again, I’m working out, I’m learning, doing all the things that made me who I was. I mean, fuck sex. It’s great and sure, it’s still an aspiration of mine, however I got discipline now. I used to have it, before I obviously lost it, but when you’re not able to put your own motivation into words, what chance do you really have at gaining it back? Imo, I think it’s just me. I have to be able to put my emotions and feelings into words, otherwise I have difficultly relating to what I’m trying to grasp.

As with the original intention of this article, I can’t stand being fit. I’m kind of this lean, skinny dude with tacked on muscles and I hate it. I think it detracts from who I am as a person. I’m a writer. I’d rather people focus on my words, than what I look like and clearly, the two are quite impossible.
