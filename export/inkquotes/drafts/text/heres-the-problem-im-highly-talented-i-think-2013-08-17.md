Here’s the problem. I’m highly talented. I think most people are; to some degree or other. We all have our skills and abilities, most of them inherently pointless, and everything we do IS pointless when you think about it hard enough (well duh, why do you think I like playing around with grammar so much.)

Yes, we’re highly intelligent. Fair enough. Most of us have a reasonable level of intelligence. I didn’t accidentally walk into oncoming traffic this morning. Check. 

We all have too much comfort. Too much of everything. There’s nothing we don’t really need. An abundance of everything, it’s just there. I mean, yeah. There are the things we’d like, you know, perfection. We all get that. Now here’s my problem and perhaps the problem with most young people: Purpose. 

When you have a highly intelligent + highly talented population, purpose is almost anything you want it to be. There’s so much choice, but so little PURPOSE. I feel the purpose has almost died out of me. So then the whole idea is that you develop a passion for one of your skills, and then that’s supposed to be the rest of it. 

Passion is sort of like the slippery fish that keeps escaping from your grasp, until you realise that the sucker was dead all along anyway, and now your family are dead because they were living off 

So all you have left are these pathetic little words. They’re fun though, they keep my mind preoccupied. They’ll have to do for now.
