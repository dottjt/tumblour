I’m tempted to go back to a club, so I can write about the whole experience in a little more detail. I’ll be on my phone.

Some might describe my tone as harsh and condescending, however I’m simply describing what I see. It’s not like I’m making anything up when I say that every single girl is wearing the exact same dress and make up, that no one really stands out, nor looks like they’re having a good time. Everyone obviously says that they’re having a good time, but when you take a good look at their face, you see depression and anxiety to it’s core.
