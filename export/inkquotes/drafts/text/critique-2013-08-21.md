I hate writing about myself, because there’s nothing even vaguely tragic about my life, which is why I have to fabricate it via poetry. Whenever I do, it feels like poorly conveyed arrogance. I’m fit, motivated, purposeful, happy, emotionally in control, optimistic, smart, understanding, non-judgmental, humble, I love learning and caring for others and the list goes on. 

My only critique is that I’m too rational. I’m incredibly cynical

Oh, and if there’s one thing you’ll really hate about me, it’s that I’m… well, no topic taboo. If you’re fat, I’m gonna call you names, but not because I hate you, nor care if you’re fat. I’m just stating what I see. But here’s the thing, I do it to myself as well, it’s not a prejudice thing. I’m second-rate, I’m a failure, I’m hopelessly detached from reality, I’m a cunt at times and I’m wayyyyyy too honest. Women hate it.
