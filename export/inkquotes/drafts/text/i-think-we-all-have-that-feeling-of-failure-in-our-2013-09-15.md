I think we all have that feeling of failure in our lives. I honestly believe that 99% of people fail. It’s just a basic statistic. If everyone is wants to fuck Katy Perry and only one guy in her life can have the opportunity, then guess what? You failed. I have failed. All my guy friends have failed. Yet no ever thinks that they’re a failure because we weren’t able to have sex with a celebrity.

Which begs the question, why shouldn’t we treat every other failure in our life with the same respect. I mean, any guy interested in sex WANTS to fuck Katy Perry. Yet when we feel it more over things more relative to us. 

So don’t feel so
