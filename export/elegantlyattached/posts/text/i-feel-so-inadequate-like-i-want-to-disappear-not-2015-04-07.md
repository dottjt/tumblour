I feel so inadequate like I want to disappear. Not to be confused with shame or guilt or regret or anything like that.

I guess it’s the kind of anxiety that keeps telling you: “Listen fuckwit, if you don’t read a book in 3 seconds I’m going to blow your brains out and kill your entire family.”

Okay then. 

I shall read a book and I shall enjoy said book. 

Man, you’d swear I’m going insane but I don’t know if I’m just being playfully pedantic or if my mind is actually imploding in on me. 

I mean, I guess I feel better, in that mentally ill sort of way. I feel mobile, yet oddly eerie about my own ability to do things. My self-esteem is back, but it’s not cute. I feel like that weird guy on the train licking his lips to school girls at 7am in the morning. 

I think I’m just so wired on the possibility of living. It makes me happy. Oh, fuck it. Maybe I should just work out instead so that by the time I’m done I can just collapse onto my bed and dream about cute girls in bunny outfits. 

I really, really hate myself.
