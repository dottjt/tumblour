I feel outstanding. 

I’ve just done so much of what I wanted to do today and I’m really starting to look forward to waking up in the morning now. 

This recent bout of depression is really an anomaly in my life. I’m usually happy, excited and ambitious, however when life grabs you by the throat, it’s like you have no choice but to squirm and crumble under the pressure. 

I just feel like… I no longer want to adhere to the victim mindset and I believe that’s part of the reason why my ex-girlfriend brought me down. It doesn’t matter how much you try to communicate with her, she just finds an infinite number of ways to discover pity and pity is the death of civilisation if I ever saw it. 

I managed to read my books, I did my huge workout, I skipped, I wrote a series of letters on my typewriter, I studied French, I meditated, I went out to the shops, I ate incredibly healthily and I feel back on-track with everything in my life.

Most importantly, I actually feel like I can be properly affectionate with my girlfriend. I actually desire her more than the world and all I can think about is giving her the biggest hug when I see her next. Her skin is soft and beautiful like the tide, forever washing away the guilt and shame I harbour from the past. 

It’s the worst when you’re depressed, because you don’t give all the people you love the respect they deserve. You become a ghost. 

I guess my biggest regret is that I didn’t buy that silver Gameboy Advance SP with Advance Wars 2 in it for $50, but I’m only willing to pay $30 for the combo. I’ll bargain that bitch down until I see visible tears wither from her knees or perhaps she’ll comply if I slice her throat and beat her husband down with a golf club. 

As you may tell, suburban op shops are a riot.
