Oh look, the long weekend has bled on me. Please stop bleeding. I’ve just been in a shitty mood for a while and it ain’t cute.

On the contrary I’m excited because I feel like today is a turning point for me. I’ve been so mired in guilt and shame that I haven’t been able to concentrate on anything. 

Now I’m just really keen to eat healthy, to be productive, kill a few children and who really knows… grow a cactus in a radioactive swampland. 

I’ve been playing Fallout: New Vegas with my girlfriend all day and it’s been pleasant, but there’s also that part of me which wants to explode and compress into a thousand different shapes and sizes. 

I’m going to use tomorrow to learn and catch up on all the obligations that I’ve been neglecting. I’ve been dying to learn French for a good week now, but my mood has just been strangling me like an opaque solution.

I’ve been thinking about my future career and I guess I’ve had that moment where I’ve realised that there’s so much more that I could be doing. Well, let’s do it. 

My ex has been killing me, but no longer. 

My girlfriend is baking me a cake while I watch Who Framed Roger Rabbit and it’s just terrible. Hopefully we get to record our podcast tonight though :3
