My self-esteem is back baby! 

I never thought the day would come, but I feel amazing. I actually value my time and it makes me sad that I don’t have enough time to complete all the things that I want to. 

I know I’m fragile, as I always have been, however I know I’m doing all the right things and I think I deserve to feel this way about myself. It’s as if all the worries I have of the past are behind me, though I’m sure within a week’s time I’ll be back in the blue; chuffing on cheap cigarettes to get me through the tragic death of a small baby boy. 

Instigator! We have a small problem here! 

I’m rediscovering so much about myself. I’ve started playing music really loud in my room while I dance like crazy. Nothing feels like a drag anymore. I genuinely feel like I want to live. 

Subtle images of my ex reappear within my mind, but I have a lot of hope for myself. There was a time, not long ago, where I was completely free of the past in my mind. It was blissful and I know I’m not perfect and that I’m full of holes like a bucket of swiss cheese, however I’m ambitious and alive. It feels like I’m sliding on ice. 

Destroy everything and let it burn!
