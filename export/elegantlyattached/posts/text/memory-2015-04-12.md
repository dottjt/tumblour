One thing that makes me really sad is the fact that I have no memory. 

It’s like… I start with an empty slate each and every time I wake up in the morning. I have a very vague recall of the day before and when my friends bring up things that have happened the weekend before, my mind just draws blanks. 

On the contrary I have a friend who literally remembers everything. He flawlessly quotes movies and TV shows like a machine gun with absolute precision. 

I don’t know if it’s because I repress all my memories or if it’s a skill I need to develop from scratch. Alternatively, I’m amazing at improvising. I can never follow instructions, because there’s always an alternative narrative playing in my mind. 

My girlfriend was playing the piano at my house and she was looking through my music folder and she found a piece that I’d arranged in 2013 and it’s like, holy shit, I did that? 

I think that’s a large part of my insecurity of why I always feel obliged to be a better version of myself and to be constantly productive.

I suppose it’s a double-edged sword. I find it very easy and quick to move on from trauma, but I also find it really difficult to stay in the one place, which is why I literally have to put so much effort into keeping myself on track. 

I feel useless, because I have no real recollection of who I am. I think it’s also why I go back to depression, because it is an identity I have that I’m familiar with. It’s horrible, but it gives me a sense of who I am.
