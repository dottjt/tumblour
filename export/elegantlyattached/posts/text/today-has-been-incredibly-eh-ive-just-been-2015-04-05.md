Today has been incredibly eh. 

I’ve just been feeling somewhat pointless and contrived; a kind of bastard agitation which breathes down your face and spits you out, failing to appropriate your dire need to break down and synthesise into acidic elements. 

I went to a flea market this morning and the yum cha I consumed by noon tasted like a wet sock broiled in deep, succulent, fake Chinese accent. It rolls off the tongue like a pale leprosy, seeking nothing but grey. 

My girlfriend finds it incredibly attractive when I speak Chinese, which even by my standards is deliriously quaint. I should remember to tie her up. 

I think I’m just a closet racist, though I know it’s because of my lack of finesse. I can’t seem to do anything right. 

Earlier my friend called me and he made me feel better about myself. I’d recently quit my job, amongst a series of other tragedies, and it’s been bringing me down. I’ve been spending the day with my girlfriend and I just feel like a complete and utter idiot. 

There’s hope out there somewhere in the world. At least I find it helps if I pretend I’m mentally retarded.
