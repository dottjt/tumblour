I often feel my self-esteem has always been my greatest issue. 

I know I’m talented and I know I have this amazing ability within me to just pick up that knife and start hacking away at the crowd until only the children are left, but I’m rather prone to cramping and there’s nothing worse than having to see the doctor at 5:15pm to arrange a little “play date” with your physical inadequacies. 

I get it. I murder people, but I promise it’s completely legal and trust me, suppressed memories are much more feint that meets the eye.

I clearly take my sarcasm way too seriously, though watch it buddy. I’m a maniac. 

I think I’m just weighed down by doubt and fear. I feel so incapable that I just shut down and seize myself into an imaginary chokehold, waiting for god to just snap my neck and get it all over and done with.

You fucking asshole. Please kill me. Oh, the tragedy. 

You know, I strongly believe that self-esteem is something that takes time to develop. On the contrary, it is destroyed almost instantly overnight and it’s sad to see the confidence dissipate into a slurry of regret, however I see no point in my being afraid of myself. 

I will fight until my knuckles are covered in blood. In actual fact, I find that acceptance and humility works a little better, however we can’t all be winners now. 

I’ve managed to achieve so much today and I can literally feel the drain on my eyelids. There’s something very odd about living healthily. It feels like being handed more freedom than one can possibly handle. 

Learning French on the other hand seems to exhaust my freedom. There are so many fucking words that I feel like the task is endless, though I guess that’s part of the excitement. 

The anxiety is luscious tonight.
