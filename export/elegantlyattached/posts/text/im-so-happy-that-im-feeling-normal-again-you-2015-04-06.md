I’m so happy that I’m feeling normal again. 

You go through these periods of anxiety/guilt/depression and you have no idea when it’s going to end and I feel so sorry for my girlfriend, because I’ve spent the entire long weekend with her and she’s had to deal with the most horrible person and it’s only been in the last couple of hours that I’ve started acting like myself again where I can be loving and providing. 

It’s like… a miracle. 

The sad thing is that I know at some point I’ll go back into my depression and though it makes me vaguely worried, I think my recent mood has just been plagued by a barrage of bad luck.

I quit work because they’ve been fucking me over, my ex thought it would be a good idea to start talking again which is a huge trigger for me and everything just seemed to be working against my favour. 

It’s like all these problems and all the negativity in my life is just behind me. It doesn’t strike me with hesitation or worry. I just feel eager to be happy and to be myself. 

No human is infallible. Mental illness is just your tolerance to bullshit and no matter what, people will break if you push them far enough.

Don’t promise sins you cannot fulfil.
