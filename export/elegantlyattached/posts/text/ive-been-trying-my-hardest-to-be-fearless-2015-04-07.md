I’ve been trying my hardest to be fearless, however deep down inside I want to breakdown and explode into a violent death of nuclear gore.

Today has been superficially positive and while there have been moments where I’ve felt pride within myself, I mostly feel inclined to appuyer sur dommage.

The weather today really hasn’t helped. Grey clouds and rain. Thanks mum! 

I do not plan on jeopardising myself. I know it’s going to take time. I’ve been eating really healthy; you know, the kinds of meals that make you feel like shit, but will make you feel better in the coming days. I’ve stretched, meditated, studied french and I don’t want to orgasm for a good two weeks. I think I may just have to work out, even though I really have no purpose to. 

I wouldn’t say that I’m living in fear. It’s probably more under the guise of doubt. I have goals, however I have no direction and it’s like being suspended in a meticulously bullshit goo that just bullshits it’s way through everything. 

It’s like having to drag yourself along a marathon, simply because you know it’s what your father would have wanted you to do. 

I’m going to learn some more French, hopefully write some articles for my website, do my puzzle, read my book. Meditation gives me wings. 

The uncertainty is literally murdering me.
