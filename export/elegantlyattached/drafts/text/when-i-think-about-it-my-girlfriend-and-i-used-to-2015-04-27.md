When I think about it, my girlfriend and I used to have mental breakdowns every single time we met up for the first few months.

One of us would break down into tears, yet I also think that’s what makes our relationship so good. We’re always willing to talk about everything and I think we’ve had just about every difficult conversation out there, to the point that we can just be free with ourselves.
The main thing is that our prior trauma still remains and it is something we are invariably vulnerable. My ex still affects me and violence is a trigger for her.

I think my ex will always have an effect on me, simply because she is an idea lost in time, never to be retrieved. It would almost be if you had a miscarriage or something irreversible and you sort of wondered what it would be like if things had gone right.

It is a direct refusal to accept reality, which is why I have accepted the reality I have created for myself today. In fact, I believe it is far superior, however there will always be that cognitive dissonance within me.

In a sense I miss my depression, however it’s hard to say what I actually miss. I think I miss that sinking feeling in my stomach. It’s the exact opposite ambition and fulfilment, however it’s just as satisfying in many ways and less effort than actually having to do something.
