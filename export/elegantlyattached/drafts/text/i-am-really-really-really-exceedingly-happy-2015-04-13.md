I am really, really, really, exceedingly happy with myself today. 

I’ve done just about everything that I’ve wanted to and I didn’t allow myself to become excessively distracted. I got to skip, I got to do my workout, I read my fucking book, I’ve made some great progress on my articles and I’m eating crazy healthy and everything is just splendid! 

When I woke up this morning, it was the worst thing ever. I felt horrible, demotivated and just generally pointless and indifferent to life.

However I just wasn’t going to let that ruin me and so I said fuck it and I put on the loudest dance music I could find and I let it loose. So I’m feeling all good, then I Skype call my mother and we have the biggest fight I think we’ve ever had and it went for hours and she basically just said the most horrible things you could think of about my girlfriend and after that, I just felt somewhat… destroyed again.

I didn’t let that ruin me however.
