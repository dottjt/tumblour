Hey ladies.

Read carefully. You’re about to get some exclusive introspective into the male mind. 

You’re about to witness an insecure piece of shit, transform into a cynic almost instantly. Brace yourself.

So perhaps you’re wondering why I tried so hard to give up on orgasm. Let me tell you why.

It makes become obsessed with women. Though in a good way. You want to be with them. Hear their concerns. Look after them. You become the generous, caring figure. A gentleman. Sometimes hehe.

Now for most girls, that freaks them out, because they’re so insecure and traumatized from prior encounters with men, that it puts me at a complete disadvantage. Why even bother?

Well guess what!? You now won’t have to worry about my obsession any longer! 

I suppose you’re happy. Here’s what you get instead.

a) A complete apathy for women. I no longer have feelings for women. Instead of going through the bullshit of having to impress some stranger who’s going to end up leaving me anyway due to her own insecurities or fact that she doesn’t want to deal with mine, I now have the splendid option to blow my load to another, more attractive girl on my computer screen, who isn’t going to question my ethics.

b) I don’t even care about women for sex, flirt, my emotions, anything. I don’t care. There’s a point to which you’re so deficient of oxytocin, that you say fuck it. I’m a dopamine machine now. Porn is my savior. 

I give up. I’m a broken man.
