The sully touch of my swollen breath lingers hapless like candy, along the tip of your vulnerable thigh. It creeps slowly like cancer into the fabric of your skin; penetrating the bones of your whore. A sudden jolt tingles ecstatic through your spine; dazed delinquent by the mercy of my hands. I grab you by the throat as you collapse to the floor. I tread you and burn. Youâ€™re helpless like fire, yet passionate and crazed.

These decrepit fingers are hungry and cold. They demand the essence of your warmth.
