I think it’s important to have perspective when it comes to love, because when you’re so desperate, that within itself becomes a form of disillusion. It’s important to understand what love is and what it means, because I currently feel like I could just about attach to anyone. I’m so desperate for that feeling of affection and cuddles, that reality no longer phases me. Oh, please give me that sugar baby.

In a sense, I fear myself when it comes to love, because I’m so good at convincing people that it’s true love, when really it’s just a heightened sense of lust. You could say I’m a manipulator in that sense. But like, not in a fucked up way. I’ll just write you heaps and heaps of poetry, cute snapchats and the sort, just to reinforce this idea of emotional security in my head. It’s very dangerous.
