I don’t have a penis.

I have this shrivelled, Cambodian looking thing and I don’t even think it speaks my own language. It sort of hovers around, desperately seeping the walls of underpants, flopping about as it collectively dies and recedes into my now vagina looking crevasse.

It’s too scared to play. Too small to think. It’s like rubbing your face against E.T’s sordid face, as if pain were a simple reminder of your own existence.
