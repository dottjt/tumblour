I don’t think I’ve ever had a fuck buddy.

I have no idea how this makes me feel. Irregardless, the grass is always going to seem greener on the other side of the hill, so raze the fields I say!

I just think it makes you incredibly more desensitized when you’re actually with a woman. 

How hands is pretty big for me. 

Fuck. 

I swear I’m not socially retarded.

If it’s a girl I’ve instantly fallen in-love with, then I’m like this blog of jelly that no one can understand. But if it’s with someone who I’m just testing the waters with (which if it’s that difficult within the first place, why bother?), then I’m generally 100% full in control. 

I’m fairly good with girls. I know exactly what to say and when. Except if I love them. Then I break down slowly and I feel a deep shame.
