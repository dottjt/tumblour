I’ve been severely limiting myself on tumblr because I believe this website is a major facilitator of my depression. In fact, if you have any anxiety/depression related issues, then the addictive nature of social media really isn’t serving you well. 

By avoiding tumblr, it directly destroys two birds with one stone since a) tumblr has just about been my only outlet for dating and b) I’m taking my illness very seriously. 

What I’m really hoping to do, is resensitize my reward circuitry from such addictive components as tumblr, drugs, orgasm, sugar etc. so I can gain back control of my thoughts and emotions. 

I don’t want to have to look at someone else’s life and feel inferior about my own and I don’t want to have to see pornography and be conned back into thinking that sex, and eventually women, are what I need in my life right now. 

Fuck off. 

This all comes down to addiction and for the first time, I feel like I have a plan to get through it. I plan that isn’t setting myself up for failure like every other time. At the very least, I’m trying. I really am. 

I can happily say that I’m on the road to recovery. Already, I feel much, much better about myself, but I’m obviously still vulnerable. This will take time. 

Two days ago, I woke up. 

Classic. 

I noticed it was 12am and I’d planned to go to Camberwell market, but eh, obviously that was no longer on the books. I was sleeping on the floor and surrounded by a haze of mess. In an instant, I announced to the world in a very simple phrase: “Let’s do things right for once." 

Something had overcome me. I think I’d just grown tired of feeling hopeless. It wasn’t the life for me. 

I cleaned up my entire room, to the point of being spotless. I have my PMO addiction under control. I went one day without smoking weed, however I decided to have a cone today and I don’t regret it. The buzz was for about an hour and I ate dinner during it anyway. Now I’m alert and focused and I’ve been reading since. 

My nutritional diet is 100% under control. I’ve been eating EXTREMELY healthy these past few days, taking vitamins, fish oil tablets etc. I’m eating a strict paleo diet and I eventually want to be in ketosis within the next few weeks. No sugar. No junk. No tempting bullshit.

I’m going to give my body the respect it deserves. 

Surprise, surprise, I’m back to my standing desk and I’ve pretty much stood for most of today, to read articles on how I can best progress with my depression. It’s helped me immensely, especially in terms of perspective. For example, meditation is very helpful in helping overcome anxiety/depression. I’ve also been looking back into my Self-awareness teachings. 

I’m also getting GOOD sleep. In fact for as long as I can remember, last night was the first time in a long while I’d gone to bed before 12pm. I woke up at 7am today and I’m incredibly proud of myself. 

I’m so eager to read books and learn, it’s not funny. It’s pretty much all I’ve done today. This is undoubtedly the growth phase in regards to my "life”, which generally lasts until I fall in-love, which is now something I’m fearing. 

Because for the first time in a while, I feel liberated. I feel in-control. I feel like this is who I want to be. While affection is decidedly nice, this is probably the first time I’ve actually been scared at the prospect of finding a partner. 

I don’t want to lose what I have now and ultimately, it’s made me much more cautious about love taking place, now that I’ve (hopefully) reached the end of the tunnel. 

I feel driven by my pure desire to improve myself and I’m giving this my best shot. Will I be depressed again? Of course I will, I can guarantee it. However does it have to be within the next few days, let alone weeks, let alone months, let alone years?

All I can say is that every time you fall, you learn a different technique to pick yourself back up and I’ve become an incredibly resilient man. 

Though not without a lot of suffering.
