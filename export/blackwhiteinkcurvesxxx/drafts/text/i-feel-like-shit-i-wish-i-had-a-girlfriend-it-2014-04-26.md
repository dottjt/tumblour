I feel like shit. 

I wish I had a girlfriend. It would honestly improve reality ten fold.

Unfortunately it’s not something you can force. You can’t force love to happen. You can’t make it spark without the right ingredients. All you can do is wait hopelessly while you slowly die on the inside.

I have a difficult time finding love. I’m just too different.

It could be worse.

I was talking to a friend and he’s quite popular. He also lives in a bit of a scummy area and he constantly has girls contacting him over facebook for sex. I mean, I really do wish it were that easy. I play people like fiddles.
