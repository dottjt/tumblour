I had a most profound dream last night. 

Basically, I went on a date with my high school crush, also known as the “tram chick”.

I was 16 years old and she was a complete stranger to me. I had no idea what school she went to, who she was, her name, all that jazz.

Yet in-spite of this, I was hopeless obsessed with her. Not just obsessed, but downright silly. I knew she kinda lived within the vicinity of my area and I remember trawling myspace to no avail for hours, in the hope that I might just even glimpse at her presence.

To me she was an angel. Everything about her is perfect. Even now, she’s still stunningly gorgeous and I can’t quite get it out of my head. Actually, I can’t say I really care any more, but by golly gosh, she’s still the dream picture in my mind.

Think of one of those rich, white, indie Camberwell girls with a twist. She was incredibly humble and elegant. Everything about her was humble, yet extravagant. Her hair. Oh god, though it was her blush that really spoke to me. Later I found out she was incredibly talented with art and photography. Just wow. Perfection on steroids.

So here’s me, this cynical, loser kid who couldn’t ever dream of getting pussy at my single-sex, academically elitist high school and so all I ever had was hope. The hope to die.

It was quite obvious what was up. I would continually stare at her, then stare away as she caught me. However in an act of courage beyond my peers, I decided to ask her out one/two years later.

It was terrifying. Mind you, I was 16 years old. People that age have zero self-esteem and honestly, I was a complete nervous wreck. I had no idea how to talk to girls, I didn’t really have any looks, I was incredibly typical and outcast. But I had to. I had to do it for myself.

I was basically shaking all day at school. I couldn’t think. I couldn’t concentrate. I had intense butterflies. But

However I’m proud. I did something 99.99% of people wouldn’t even dream of. So yes, I’m a little clumsy and oh god, dare I say I’m human, but fuck anyone who has a go at me for trying. I ridicule myself enough, but to have the world trickle stupid down my back, is unnecessary.
