“She says I’ve got the best beating heart in the world and it makes her want to twirl around until she hit’s the ground." 

I don’t know if you’ve heard of the band Sing It Loud, however I’ve been listening to a lot of their music and it’s disturbing me greatly. The harmony they use signifies a reality of displacement of improper placement. There’s a quality of "hollow death” in the brittle texture of these lyrics.

“until she hit’s the ground.” - I mean, this is the most feel good music in the whole entire world and they smack you with that bad boy?
