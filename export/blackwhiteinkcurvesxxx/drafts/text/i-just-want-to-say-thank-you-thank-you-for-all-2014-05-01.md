I just want to say, thank you. Thank you for all the heart break.

I may not deserve to be insecure, however I certainly deserved what had me coming. It’s all my own fault, because it’s purely my own insecurity; no one else is to blame. I deserve the pain, because I’m not ready to love yet. If I’d fallen in love, it would have further exacerbated the problem.
