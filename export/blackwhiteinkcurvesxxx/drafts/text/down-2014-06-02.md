One thing I’ve noticed, coming down from pornography addiction, is how truly irrelevant sex is to our lives. 

I think people forget how incredibly ingrained sex is in our society. It’s prevalent everywhere. There’s this faulty assumption that if you’re not getting any, for whatever reason you life is less than those who are. 

I mean, I ain’t getting any, so how does it even apply to my life? Am I somehow any less human? Am I any less the person I was one month ago? 

I think it’s easy to be sucked into a world of lust and desire. You see all these images everywhere, be it porn or elusive advertising to music videos, constantly selling you this idea that, “you need to orgasm, cause it’s the best fucking thing in the world!”

I can’t help but disagree, but obviously it’s very easy to be sucked into that notion. 

I’m not saying that I have no desire for sex, because that would be disingenuous. 

If you think from the perspective of procreation, surely you only need to ever have sex once in your life, for it to ever have significant meaning?
