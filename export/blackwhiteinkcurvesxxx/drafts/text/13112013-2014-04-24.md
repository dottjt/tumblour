I feel empty. It’s like I want to feel, but my body is physically unable to produce any emotions. It has no basis for life. It wants to breathe, yet it has no requirement. It wants to see where there is nothing to visually grasp. My body is an empty hull.

It’s like I want to live, but my heart sees no point in beating. It is lost in a sea of confusion. It has no definition of what it seeks. It’s an abandoned organ, gathering dust where it seeks life. Break ups surely cannot be easy, but it is hoped that there be faith for one to hold.

All I want is to be happy, and yet even that seems like such a gargantuan task. Well from our sorrow, let us build a fountain of stell. Let us climb to the top of our mountain, if even a step it may seem. I don’t know what I want, but my shadow needs time to heal.
