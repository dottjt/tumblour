I hope this makes sense to you.

I’m a so-called journalist, which means I’m obsessed with the truth.

Feelings don’t need words to express. Truth is a feeling.

Truth is a conscious construct. It’s a rational objectification. It’s an idea. Unless if you can find a non-biological conscious constituent i.e. god, words will never be as profound as a feeling.
