Well, what else is there really to say?

I have no desire to write. I’m just really, considerably happy with my life.

I haven’t touched junk food at all. Not even a hint of sugar has entered my body. I’m working out. I’m highly functional and studious. I have zero doubt, anxiety or depression. I feel no hate or sadness. I’ve even started sleeping on the floor and my posture has thanked me dearly. I feel truly free in every sense. I don’t feel insecure about anything. I’m engaged in the present moment and it’s a wonderful sort of sentiment.

Though the kicker: I’m talking to this girl and it’s going really, really well. We have these wonderful Skype conversations and I suppose really like how she’s a really decent human being. She’s not overly opinionated, which I cannot stand in people. She’s not some pent up feminist who’s out there to complain, bitch and moan. She’s probably the most sensible girl I’ve ever met and she always has something interesting to say. I love that. 

More importantly, this is probably the first healthy interaction I’ve had with a girl in terms of dating. It’s only until now, do I realise how much of a skewed view I had on women. I would always sell myself the idea of romance, before I’d even met the person and gotten to know them. So really, I was attached to the image I had of them, as opposed to who they really were. It was only once I got to know them, did everything fall apart.

I’m so glad to know this.

I remember after our first Skype conversation, thinking that something wasn’t right.

We’re meeting up tomorrow :)
