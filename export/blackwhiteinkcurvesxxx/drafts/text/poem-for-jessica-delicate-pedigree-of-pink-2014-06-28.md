Poem for Jessica. 

Delicate pedigree of pink, green and grey; your beauty a mystery to the palette of your name. Swindle beaches dream death row saint; seeping dementia gorging thick on the tip of your pain. Fake gestures humble disease; your bite cranks nature into packets of ease. 

Sensatious touch, gorging flesh. The starved fingers of yur affection dissipating scream; will you scream for me? Red lips, porcelain smiles; your grace is a grave my heart cannot brave. It fights for your glory. It begs for your shame. 

A gallant flow of conscious euphoria wreaks havoc on the decrepit impulsiveness of my hollow heart. Chew me with haste; a promise you cannot make.

So bite me. You must.
