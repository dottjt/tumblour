On the one hand, I can’t be trusted. I study manipulation, seduction, propaganda etc. to a minute detail and I observe behaviours.

On the other hand, I could very well be the best thing that happens to your life. 

I don’t really think it’s about an issue of trust. I’m incredibly skeptical of everything, but I also have inherent trust in my own ability to extrapolate and influence. That’s why I hang out with some truly fucked up people, because I know I’m ultimately in-control of myself and that’s what gives me faith. Yes, mere faith.
