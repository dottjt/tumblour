I have an obsession with this game.

Let me start by saying that it’s the worst fucking mario game I’ve ever played. It’s frustratingly tedious. The control are… make me want to scream. Yet I love it like a mother loves their child. 

Charm. It has so much fucking charm. I adore the cell-shaded art style. It’s like candy to the eyes. 

A lot of my predisposition is subconscious.

Growing up in primary school, my mother would constantly compare me to my best friend. “Gee, why can’t you be more like him? Look at how great his grades are? Yours are shit, he’s better than you.” That would possibly explain why I was so insecure in front of my mother and still am. I can’t be myself with her. I just can’t.

Anyway, context aside, this kid was the epitome of perfect and I tried to be like him. He played piano amazingly, so I felt convinced to learn piano as well. I didn’t get very far and I sucked at it. I hated piano. 

One of the things I really admired about him, was the vast video game collection he had. He got a GameCube when it first came out which was like, da fuq, because I used to be really poor and my family couldn’t afford anything. 

So yeah, I’ve played it a couple of times and I ended up beating it, though arguably it was the most unpleasant experience of my life.
