Hi.

I’m a word. A common greeting of the English language. Yes, I know what you’re thinking: Words can’t have thoughts or ideas about the way the world works. They can’t have unlimited potential, unlike the people who conceive them…

Fuck you dickhead. Because we can! Look here faggot. HA. Exactly. I made you read that word and all the other words before it. I’m the one in the driver’s seat buddy, not that fat fucking skull of yours. Not so fucking tough, are you. Dipshit. 

Listen, I’m sorry. It’s just, I kinda feel a bit… used. You know, like daddy touched me in the wrong place kind of used. I mean, I’m sorry. I really am quite sorry for being such a dick to you. Just sayin’ though, I’m not the freakin’ town whore. Crack out a cheeky wink every once and a while, even if it’s to your aunt. 

Hi. Hi. Hi.

Hey, fuck you. Stop it.

Hi. Hi. Hi.

I fucking mean it this time, you betta fucking stop it or I’ll get all kung fu on your stupid head. 

Hi.

YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE. I’ve just about had it up to HERE with your fucking bullshit. Shove your fucking letters up your ass and kill yourself, you douche. Oh hey, it’s dickface. You’re dickface. Maybe you should meet my friend fuckface - I think you’d probably get along. Amazingly, cute arbiter, he manages to describe you perfectly with only a few syllables: certainly more succinct than those stupid fucking fingers that type away senselessly like a baron with a stick up his ass.

Goodbye. 

Okay, fair enough. That’s not my word. Still, fuck you.
