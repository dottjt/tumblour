As you can probably tell, I love to write. I literally write for hours on end and it’s not just that, but the obsession goes beyond the grammar before you.

First, I learnt to touch type. Woah, that’s all you say!? Well, first I learn to touch type in Qwerty and then that wasn’t enough, so I decided to learn to type using Colemak. The problem is that Qwerty was in fact designed to slow down the typing speeds, because . It’s estimated that typing distance between the keys is 50% less than if you were to use Qwerty! It also means less stress on the hands.

I used to play this thing called type-racer on the internet, where you’d verse people in a typing race to see who could type the paragraph the quickest. I also practice my handwriting and I’m obsessed with the ways you can make curves look pretty. I should upload some of work, but I’m thinking of leaving this blog text only for the time being. 

I also quotes in my spare time. I’ve written thousands of facebook quotes that I never plan on publishing, considering I don’t post on facebook at all.
