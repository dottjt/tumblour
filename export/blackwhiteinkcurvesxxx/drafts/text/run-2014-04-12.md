When you’re afraid, you run.

Often the trauma is so great, that you find yourself running away from your insecurities. You’re so fucking scared of who you are, that you’re willing to destroy yourself several times over, just so you can be content with the never-content. You will always be miserable, no matter who you become, because the worry is what drives you. It eats away at your soul, like a rust to a delicate fine spoon.

That’s why it’s important to dissolve the fear or forever be tainted by your own inability to live.

I feel myself running away. Away from myself. Away from everything I stand for. In a sense, I suppose it’s how you run that counts. I’m currently in the endaevor to make myself as fit and hot as possible. I want to be so fucking muscular. Subconsciously, this is probably an effort so that I won’t ever be heartbroken again. The girl won’t have a reason to: I’ll be so hot. lul.

Of course I don’t want to have a hot fucking body. I’m a writer. I want to have a clear mind. Oh gee, I suppose I can have both.
