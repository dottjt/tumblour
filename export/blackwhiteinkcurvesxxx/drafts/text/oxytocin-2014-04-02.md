Allow me to explain the miracle chemical which may be the answer to all your problems. Yes. Depression, OCD, anxiety, addiction, isolation, you name it. It’s not exactly the cure, however it’s about as close as you’ll get to one. 

So ugh, what exactly is oxytocin? Well, think of it as the feel good, bonding, attachment chemical. It’s basically the pair bonding chemical you get from hugging, looking into each others eyes, basically think all that cutesy teenage romance stuff. 

So why is it so powerful? Well, let’s put it this way. In addition to oxytocin, you also have dopamine, which is your motivation pathway.
