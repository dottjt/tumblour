It’s been a while since I did drugs.

I used to smoke weed, though not obsessively and I was always quite cautious with my tolerance. Less is always better. For the first year it was once a week. I didn’t really know anyone who sold it and so when you got it, you fucking cherished it. Then once you began to know people, things became a little more liberal.
