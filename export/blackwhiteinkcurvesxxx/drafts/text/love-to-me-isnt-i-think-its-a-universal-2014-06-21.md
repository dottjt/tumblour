Love to me isn’t… I think it’s a universal concept. I don’t think you need to have a partner to experience love. We’re surrounded by love in everything we do, because ultimately, love is an attitude towards life.

Here’s one thing I learnt today. 

Some people say they’re scared of commitment or they don’t like being in a relationship, because they can’t do what they want or they’re limited by their 

In that case, I would say that it’s not true love. If there’s that much friction, then why are you even in a relationship in the first place? 

Way too many people are in relationships for the basic sake of insecurity. They do it because they think this is what society requires of them. They’re pressured into a relationship, perhaps imperfect, because to them it’s a huge privilege, not a burden. After all, not people would rather be in a fulfilling relationship than be single. 

Of course, the key word here which is misinterpreted by most: fulfilling. 

Is sitting around watching TV all day or being cute with your partner (because that’s the “easy” thing you have in common) really something you’d consider ‘fulfilling’? I mean, just as I said in my last post that sex was nothing more than friction between your own privates - where is the complexity? Where is a 

Yes, you’re right. Don’t worry, I know where you’re coming from. 

I understand the pleasure and the dopamine and the “wow, I’m having sex” and the whole facade of logical mumbo-jumbo.

But how much better is solving world hunger. How much better is physically reading 600 pages of text. How much better is exercising and having a greater body.

Listen, this is simple matter of perspective. 

Ideally, a functional relationship based upon solid fundamentals is amazing. 

Love doesn’t scare me. Love doesn’t taunt me. 

Because guess what? I love myself and that’s the greatest feeling of all. You can produce when you want. You’re not dependent on another person to dictate the way you feel. 

A partner is someone who you can share these qualities with.

Sometimes when it’s so similar, you end up loving the “different” version of yourself aka them.
