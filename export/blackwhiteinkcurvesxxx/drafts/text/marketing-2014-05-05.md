Marketing doesn’t really do anything for me. I consume very little branded merchandise. 

I drink water. I don’t eat snacks. However I buy groceries and I usually eat two, healthy meals a day.

I don’t buy video games. I don’t buy clothes. I don’t decorate my room (though I’d love to have a French flag hanging on my wall).

My life is largely intellectual.

I write, which costs virtually nothing. I read, which the internet has made free. 

With that said, I still buy things.

I purchase alcohol when I’m with friends. I love drugs, particularly from the NBOMEe range.
