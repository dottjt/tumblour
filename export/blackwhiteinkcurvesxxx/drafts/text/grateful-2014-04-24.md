Gratitude is an important skill to learn. It is a practice which is something I ask myself everyday. I take a few minutes of each day, to write down what I’m most grateful for and the intent is that it demonstrates to yourself that you’re not only capable, but responsible for your own emotional wellbeing. It shows that you have the power to change the way you feel and that no one else is responsible. Not even the outside world.

Trauma is one of these things I’m grateful for.

Without trauma, I would not be who I am today.
