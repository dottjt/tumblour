So I’m sitting here, degrading in the spotlight of my own insolence, you know; a temporary sort of dullness which you hope will gather pace over the coming months and soften into a light peck on the cheek, which really is to suggest a ritual of no utter importance. Oh, how crass of me. 

The bright flicker of this downlight is intimidating me, so much so, that it breathes it’s guilt down my neck and through my spine like some sort of botched prank gone wrong. The eight headed hydra is seeping sully into the great hands of our generation. Someone please tell it to stop. The halt is in the delivery.
