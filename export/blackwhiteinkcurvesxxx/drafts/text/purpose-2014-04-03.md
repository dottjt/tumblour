I think the great distinction in my writings compared to others, is that I don’t really care about what you think in regards to the words I present on this screen. My desire is one and only: To explain the dynamics of how you think and reasons that underpin your thoughts and opinions.

I don’t intend to judge or to criticise or put people down. These are all insecurities that don’t exist in your mind. It’s a mark to suggest you’re helpless. That you have no responsibility over your ability to exert power. Elements of shame and guilt arise - petty emotions for your overwhelming soul.

All I want to do is understand and empathise and that becomes impossible once people start to become defensive. Ideas need liquidity and flow.
