My girlfriend broke up with me on April 5th.

The girl I’m currently seeing added me on Facebook May 4th. 

So yes. Fuck you tumblr feminists. It took me less than one month of search through the worst of you lot, just so I could find a girl who wasn’t completely indoctrinated by their own retardation.

Of course, I’m just being satirical now ;)

You know the best thing about her? She isn’t crazy about feminism. She doesn’t have the inherent need to force her opinion down your throat. She isn’t crazy about saving the whales. She won’t belittle you for being a guy. She isn’t crazy about promoting some agenda.

She’s just really smart and decent. Is it that hard to just be intelligent and respectful?

Clearly.

On the other hand, I’ve just been brilliantly happy. I haven’t touched any sugar or bad foods, at all. I’ve been eating super healthy. I’ve been working out. I’ve been studying. I’ve been sleeping on the floor.
