It’s interesting to look back at my romances and how they’ve progressed over time. 

My first girlfriend was… well, I don’t think anything ever compares to the first relationship and in retrospect, I’m so incredibly glad that it was imperfect. Seriously glad. It was long distance and dare I say, it was the first person I ever truly cared about. In a sense, I’ve described her as the mother I never had - all that affection I craved, yet never received. It’s weird seeing how some people interact with their parents, because it’s a serious culture shock to me. They actually express themselves to their parents, whereas my mother feels like a stranger to me. It’s like I have no attachment to her. She’s just there as a label in my life. 

I’m so grateful for my first. She was my first love. I was incredibly cynical before then, I thought all girls were retard. Then I met her. She showed me it was possible to experience something magical with another person. 

We were both quite interested in writing and our romance relied on prose.
