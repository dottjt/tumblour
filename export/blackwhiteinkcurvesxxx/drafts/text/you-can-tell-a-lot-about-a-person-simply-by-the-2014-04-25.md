You can tell a lot about a person, simply by the way they choose to express themselves.

Some people like to remain completely anonymous.

Other people put their location, their age and their name. Some people even feel compelled to tell people about their ethnicity and what they look like.

Location and gender really is the only thing Iâ€™m particularly concerned with. Personality is implied.
