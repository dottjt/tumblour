Everyone has their need. Their fix. Their insecurity.

For me, it’s love and affection. I just want a girl to hold me, tell me I’m special and cuddle me.

For others, it may be a TV show. Perhaps they love to learn (I know I do). It could be purely sexual.

Of course, everyone also has their speciality. For me, I know how to make things exciting. I know how to use my hands very well.
