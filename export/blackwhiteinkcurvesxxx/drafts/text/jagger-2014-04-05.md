I’m feeling somewhat cautious about love now. I’m not afraid of anything per say, however I feel I don’t want to take anything too quickly with anyone, cause that really is my biggest problem.

I remember meeting my last girlfriend 

I get so caught up in the hype of a union and what it could represent, that I don’t focus on the reality that our short-comings bring. I’m the romantic optimist, so to speak.
