I love seduction as an art.

Like all good arts, it’s completely improvised.

Seduction is a highly fluid construct. In many cases, it has very little to do with gender, nor sex. It’s about the intrigue you create; the character you perpetrate and the flirt you’re willing to have. 

People are inherently disturbed when you openly talk about your seduction. Hilariously, their either a) they’d rather not be seduced, whereby they become dulled or b) they’d rather be lied to about their seduction, whereby they end up hurt and confused. I have too much respect for that and personally, I think honesty is more efficient anyway.

Give me an hour at the park and we’ll be necking in no time. The speed at which it happens, honestly scares the shit out of me. As a result, I’m usually despondent during the second half of a date. I feel like I’ve created a monster.

Of course, it’s how you sell it. I generally do a couple of things that work really well for me.

I’m really quirky/funny/cute. Yet underneath the polished exterior, it’s actually an inherently aggressive attitude. You always push forward, making subtle increments into the obviously. With that said, always remain respectful and if they’re not buying it, recede back. It’s key to remain transparent as well. Let’s say I get my hand around your shoulder. Afterwards, I always make some ridiculous/witty/exaggerated comment about the fact that my hand is now around your shoulder and it makes the person feel a lot more comfortable when you do it. If I tell you that I’m going to put a bullet in your head, inevitably you’re going to freak out. However if I tell you that you’re a sweet angel, THEN shoot you… well, you become a lot more compliant. Humour is also my forte. I can make anyone laugh, even the Hitler’s of this world, so no qualms there.

You only move forward when you think you’re gaining some traction. You do this via pair bonding, which promotes oxytocin. So, for example, a lot of the shy girls have difficulty with eye contact. This is a natural response, because they’re scared of that sweet, sweet oxytocin. So regularly, I’ll ask them if I can look into their eyes and then I’ll reaffirm them by telling they’re beautiful, before pulling a stupid face and calling them a slut whore, quickly followed by a cute hug and a silly voice. Ah yes, I’m not stupid. I know exactly what I’m doing.

The magic is that it’s all improvised. I have no rules. I just go in, force myself into a tight spot and pledge to come out on top.

If you’re skeptical, listen. This strategy doesn’t work particularly well on uptight bitches and your “Hitler” type girls who have personalities made of rough steel. It generally attracts nice women who aren’t overly judgemental or insane. This is a good thing for me. I don’t want those girls. Keep them away.

Also, you have to understand that it only works if you’re a good product to sell. I’m incredibly nice and respectful and I understand boundaries enough that I’m willing to push them, but I do it on purpose. It speeds up the process tenfold.

So first I put my arm around your shoulder. Then we hold hands. Then we cuddle and hold heads together. blah. blah. blah.
