Occasionally you’ll see one of those grunge chicks on the way to uni. You know who I’m talking about, the ones who wear the wayfarers or the chokers with the floral dress and my first instant reaction is: Fuck, how do you get close to that shit? 

I wish I knew a grunge chick or was part of the scene, that’d be so cool. I guess you have to do something that’s a bit grungy and out there as well. I actually look quite nice with a choker, but I dunno if I could do it. 

The thing with me, is that I love getting along with everyone and I’m more indie that most people, I just feel that part of my image, is to not express who I am physically via fashion. I’m the kind of person who wants to win you over with my words and my expression; my wit and my humor. I want to amaze you with my knowledge, not my $50 haircut (mind you, I still get my mother to cut my hair because it don’t cost me nothin’.)
