Empowerment is a fallacy. It is not real. It exists as an illusion to prop up your ego, just so it can be torn back down again. It is a coping mechanism to deal with the fact that some have no self-esteem. 

If you unconditionally love yourself, you do not so-called “empowerment”. Why? Because you are neither any more or any less powerful than you ever were. You always had the power to begin with and no amount of ego is going to increase or decrease that statistic. 

It’s all a simple matter of insecurity.
