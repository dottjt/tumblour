By abstaining for orgasm/sex/masturbation, you begin to realise that sexual desire is nothing more than a simple image in your head. You probably think that observation is insignificant, but without understanding the dynamics of your own thoughts, you will cease to succeed in your endeavours, almost every single time.

Observation is the first key to self-awareness. Otherwise, you cannot catch yourself in a doubt of mania and you proceed to destroy all that you’ve created. 

You’ll see a really pretty girl in public and you’ll get really turned on, but it isn’t changing the fact that:

a) You’re not talking to her. You’re not going to talk to her.

b) You’re not going to fuck her and she is not going to fuck you.

c) You’re never going to see her again in your life.

Yet out of nowhere, we get so worked that we cannot help but lust.

In a sense, the temptation is silly, however it goes to show the power of the imagination and how beliefs are so easily triggered by cues.
