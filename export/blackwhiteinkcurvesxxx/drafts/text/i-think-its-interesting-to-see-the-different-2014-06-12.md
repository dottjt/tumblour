I think it’s interesting to see the different perspectives. My friends who shall remain nameless, is living in a dormitory with med students, as he is also studying med. He’s pretty much bathed in women and his Facebook, is pretty much just him posing with other women.

This is coming from a guy, much worse than me, who was basically exposed to zero women growing up and then bam, it’s like he’s been shot into heaven; the reincarnate of a god. 

We meet up once or twice a year and he says he hates it. He doesn’t like being treated like a slut. He was telling me how he gets sexual favors from girls in the course and I’m freaking out in a positive way, but then he sighs heavily at how he just wants to be in a relationship.
