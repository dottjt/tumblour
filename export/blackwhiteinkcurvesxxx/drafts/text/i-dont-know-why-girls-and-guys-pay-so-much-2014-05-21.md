I don’t know why girls and guys pay so much attention to how they look. 

I was sitting in my tutorial yesterday and I couldn’t help but notice that… everyone is really fucking ugly. Humans are just ugly fuckers. Nothing quite looks right when you stare at someone’s face long enough and from a particular angle. 

I guess the only real redeeming feature is a person’s body. I mean, just about anyone can sugarcoat their face to look like something it’s not, but gee. 

I’ve personally never really cared about looks. If you attach yourself to someone, you can just about convince yourself to believe anything.
