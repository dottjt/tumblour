There’s something very odd about Sing It Loud. Their music is incredibly… something isn’t right. For some reason, I think it subconsciously promotes suicide.

Their music uses the most incidental harmony. It’s a sharp feeling of displacement. You physically feel manipulated beyond the very sounds themselves.
