I wrote this huge post, but I figured it’d be better if I just summarised everything …in bland, dot-point German: 

- I have an incredible sense of ambition. I suppose you could say, I’ve “rebounded.”

- I would call this a growth phase of sorts, where I just try my best to ride the wave of delusion into …whoa, what!? Is it possible I’m actually still deluded and maniac? I suppose we’ll have to find out in the not-too-distant future. I may crash like a fallen bird from the sky, but the way I see it is that incremental improvements are always better than none and for once I’m actually choosing to do something about my mental health.

- Generally when I commit to something seriously, I can keep it going for a few months. I hope. 

- I’m focusing on my happiness. I’m being inherently selfish and anti-social. I think I've definitely improved a lot and am learning a lot of things from the process.

- I also have the standing desk back and so yeah, I pretty much stand all day. 

- I have no idea why I’m doing this or if it’s going to work. [Pleased to be your resident rag doll. I’d appreciate a tip or two by now] 

- So, I’m basically giving up all my addictions, bad habits, like being sad, emo-ish, possibly defamatory, orgasm etc. I think of it as an emotional reset. I woke up 2 days ago and thought: “Let’s do something right for once”, and so here I stand, my entire room cleaned to a crisp, delivering you this fine piece of propagate; to you, dear sir. 

- I was watching Orange Is The New Black and even that was too sexual for me. I had to stop after 20 seconds. The whole idea is to get away from hyper-reality, not adopt it. Like, they’re not real breasts. They’re on a TV screen. Why am I wasting my time!?

- I’ve kind of stopped caring about girls. I mean, it’s really hard to even say anymore. However I think my problem is more to do with focus. It’s the one skill I lack and it’s why I wind up a sucker every time. But I’m doing meditation and teaching myself to focus. 

- I’m now terrified of the prospect of finding a partner and attaching, because it feels like I’ve switched over to the dark side now. When you’re independent, it’s the opposite to being a slave. You see so much opportunity outside of being stuck inside a tiny box; the box of your mind. You want to be free and your own master, not wallowed in pain you cannot even see. 

- I’m just sick of being depressed. I’m sick of feeling like shit. This is my attempt to do something about it and I really am giving this a great big effort. 

- Yesterday night was the first time in ages that I’d gone to bed before 12pm and then the next day I woke up at 7am. I was quite proud of myself and from there, I read a book for an hour. A book on will-power :3 

- I’m working on becoming emotionally independent, because I think this is a case of OCD for me. I suspect that tumblr and my writing is a form of OCD producing activity. So reading is probably a bit better for me. 

- What I’m learning to do, is develop focus, so that I don’t become anxious or have panic attacks or any of that. If I want to just study, then I can just do it seamlessly without worry. I feel like I’m really getting somewhere with this.

- Never give up. You learn something each time and it brings you one step closer towards recovery. Sure, you have moments where the darkness comes and wraps you in a whirlpool of emotional pain, but each time you suffer, you learn something exponentially in the process. 

- I’m hopeful, but I’m not going to make any claims on my life. All I can say is that I tried and hopefully I’ll keep trying into the foreseeable future so that I can slay this beast hatn bleed me no mercy.

I feel like a market cycle.
