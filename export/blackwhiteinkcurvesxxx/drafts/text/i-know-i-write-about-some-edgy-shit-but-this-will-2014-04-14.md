I know I write about some edgy shit, but this will probably cross the line for some people. I’ll probably lose a few followers, knowing this is tumblr.

Society has a very simple disease going round. It’s not a physical disease. It’s not necessarily mental. It’s rather… benign.

Let me tell you now, very clearly… you have no rights.

Nature doesn’t abide by societies laws. When a hurricane comes and wipes out thousands of people, do we create a law to ban hurricanes? Unfortunately there’s no justice in the word of our species. It is just a guise to give into fear.

People want to embrace a sense of justice. They want to make things “right” despite the the very unnatural construct of civilisation.
