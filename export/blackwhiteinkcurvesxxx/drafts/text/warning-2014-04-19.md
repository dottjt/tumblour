I will lose multiple followers upon posting this, but that doesn’t bother me. Hilariously, the post just progressively gets worse and worse.

So, let me tell you a little about flirt.

99.99% of the girls I talk to aren’t right for me. It’s not that difficult to read people and to judge

One very, very important thing to distinguish, is that when I say “right for me” I’m ultimately referring to love. Certainly not referring to close friendship. 

I believe that in part was why my last relationship didn’t work out. We just weren’t

Yesterday was maniac.

There’s a lot of context, however I’ll skip all that for the good stuff. I couldn’t stop watching porn and masturbating. I was desperate to orgasm, however thankfully and really, I am so thankful in retrospect, I didn’t end up doing it.

So I’m super horny and I was really, really desperate to get laid. Like, there’s desperate, then there’s “I’m willing to bullshit my way through anything just to get my dick wet”.

[btw, this post will probably disturb you and will certainly result in multiple unfollows, however have my reasons.]

I was messaging this girl over tumblr and I was just being nice as per usual, no real intentions. Well, fuck no. I wanted to get laid.
