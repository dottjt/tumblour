I don’t think people should feel good about their body.

Which really is to say that people shouldn’t place any emphasis on how they look at all.

Your body is not responsible for the way you feel about yourself. Your mind is. I dress terrible, but it doesn’t affect the way I feel.

Everything else is just an insecurity.
