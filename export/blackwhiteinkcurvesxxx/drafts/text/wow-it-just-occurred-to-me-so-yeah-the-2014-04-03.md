Wow. It just occurred to me. So yeah, the “alternative” people dress differently because they think differently. They are “crazy”.

Here’s the thing, I used to be different, but now I have my mental stability back.

Which means, that I can dress fucked up and take advantage of that, without actually being mentally unstable, which gives me flexibility in the characters I can play. :)
