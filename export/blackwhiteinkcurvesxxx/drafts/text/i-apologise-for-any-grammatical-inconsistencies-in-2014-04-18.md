I apologise for any grammatical inconsistencies in my posts.

Please be aware that I’ve collectively written more than 30,000 words on this blog alone within the past month, so please. I hope you understand.

When you write enough, you realise that you can literally spend days rewriting a post to make it finger licking good. However for the purposes of time and efficiency, I’d rather knock out the basic ideas and leave them be.
