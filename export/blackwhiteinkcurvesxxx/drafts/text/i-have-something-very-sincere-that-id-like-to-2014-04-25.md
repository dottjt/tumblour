I have something very sincere that I’d like to share with everyone. I haven’t told anyone about this, because it’s something that’s deeply personal and touching.

I’m in a relationship with god.

We’ve been dating since last November when my ex decided to rape me and I turned to religion to sooth the pain. He’ll usually come around; work it a little. Spit, finger and lingo. He really knows how to work my clit with those miracles he espouses. A touch up here and there, then I’m done. 

I love god. He’s like Jesus but better. Fuck Jesus.
