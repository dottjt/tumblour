I don’t know why girls don’t tease more often. Take it from me, your highly susceptible guy, vulnerable as ever to the mouth-watering sight of a female silhouette in the distance. Actually, I think I know that person… ah yes, it’s a cardboard cutout of Master Chief out front the local EB games. Let’s venture inside, shall we? 

It honestly doesn’t matter how you dress or the level at which you value your beauty. All you really have to do is come onto a guy and I guarantee 9/10 that he wants in. Of course, not all girls are like that and I can understand. Guys are horny jerks. Well, not my prized Master Chief. 

It really is the power of suggestion, the way you look into his eyes, the stature in your skin, which does most the talking. However I think the big problem when it comes to seduction, is that people worry about crossing boundaries. Yet what girls forget, is that there are literally no boundaries in the patriarchy of sexual desires. You could most likely get away with stealing my wallet, if only to leave a kiss on my cheek. Certainly not worth the few coins out the back.
