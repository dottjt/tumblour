I’ve been trying to bring myself to write all day, but I just don’t have the will. Here’s my attempt. 

I’m feeling… accomplished. Well, this is that fucker ‘ego’ talking and I really should recognise my ability to be humble. Everyone has that ability, however whether you exercise it or not, is an entirely different issue.

Listen, I want to read. I really want to fucking read and learn and be awesome, but I feel a sense of obligation to journal my life. I know it’s something I’ll thank myself for later.

So, you could say that I have a girl. I’m hesitant to say girlfriend, because the feelings aren’t quite there, however the arrangement seems rather concrete.

I don’t want to be with other girls. Part of it is lack of choice, I mean, I find it hard enough to find someone I like, let alone someone to love. Part of it is that she’s amazing. There’s so much to appreciate about her; a lot of things that go against most girls I’ve encountered. She’s snark, yet she’s incredibly non-judgemental and open-minded. Ridiculously knowledgeable and there’s a sense of wit about her which I can

She’s like a different flavour of 'me’.
