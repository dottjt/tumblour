I don’t see any point in being judgmental. I used to be really judgmental, but now my mind has a clarity that doesn’t seek to dominate or reach parity with an invisible red line I’ve drawn in my head. 

One thing you don’t realise until you stop being judgmental, is that the judgments themselves actually seek to take away your personal power, as opposed to provide it.

People primarily make judgments to prop up their ego, which in returns.

Of course, little do people know that these judgments are also the primary source for wortlessness and self-rejection. Humans have a duality of thinking “well, if I’m right, it also means I can be wrong” and when we don’t see ourselves as the image of success we were before, then

Of course, the image exists only in the viritual self of the mind. Just like how a nightmare can feel real and terrifying, doesn’t mean it actually has any implications on the external world. It’s simply all in your head.
