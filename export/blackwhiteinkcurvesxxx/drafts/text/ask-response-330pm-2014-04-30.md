Ask response. 3:30pm

Chances are, we’ve already talked multiple times in the past. We may even know each other well. Of course, I’m not going to tell you that; there’s a reason why this blog is largely anonymous. 

This will have been my 4th tumblr blog within the past year or so and chances are, you probably hated me the first few times we made introduction. It’s funny how people change once you present a different face, more potential face. Trial and error my forbidden sister.

Also, it depends at what point in my mania we met. I could have been sarcastic in my approach. Highly irrational. Downright desperate. Who even remembers.

I’ve managed to befriend a lot of “initially skeptical” people this time round. People who thought I was once complete dirt; now can clearly see the sheen.

Im a nice guy when things come to it and perspective doesn’t prefer to bite.
