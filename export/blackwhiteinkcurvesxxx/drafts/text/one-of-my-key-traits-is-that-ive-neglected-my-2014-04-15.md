One of my key traits is that I’ve neglected my cultural identity to a large extent. Though I suppose that’s easy for me, since I’m a mix of two vastly different racial backgrounds. I mean, it’s not that I don’t embrace my cultural background, it’s simply irrelevant to me. People always talk about how great their culture is, but I really don’t care. 

Let’s talk about how human we are. That’s all that matters to me.

I don’t want to have an identity. I don’t want to be limited to who I can and can’t be. I don’t want to live life through a tinted lens of superstition and cultural bias. I like to change. I like to become. I want to experience everyone equally. I don’t just want to hang around with people from my own racial background, I want to get to know everyone. 

For people it’s a form of social security, but I like not to fit in. It forces you to seek and approach.
