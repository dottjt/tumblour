Believe it or not, I struggle with the English language. Spelling in particular. 

My problem is that I don’t sound words out in my head, according to how they’re spelt. 

So for example, when I see a word, I don’t actually look at the letters and read what’s before me. I glance at the word and I say what I think it looks like.
