I don’t think it’s fair to call me a closet psychopath. I don’t attack other people or try to intentionally hurt other people’s feelings. I have no such desire. I don’t really have any overbearing grudge over anyone and I accept people for the way they are, at least I 

Rather, I think it’s about being open to the possibility and accepting that you ultimately have responsibility over your actions. You see, I’m a thinker, not a crazed gunman. Intellectual. I’m quite open minded. Often I’ll be at work and I’ll pick up a power tool and I think to myself: “Man, wouldn’t it be fucking devastating if I just drill this fucker in the head.” Or like, I’ll be riding my bike to work and I’ll think of terrible consequence, if I were to just drive straight into traffic.

Of course, I’d never actually do it. I’m not that stupid. Well, except for that one time I was on acid and I nearly died, but let’s not talk about that.
