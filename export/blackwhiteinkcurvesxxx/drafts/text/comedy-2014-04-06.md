I don’t like stand up comedy. 

The problem is that I’m a comedian myself and I write heaps of comedy. I’ve done a lot of youtubing/podcasting/radio and I appreciate humor in a different way. Like, I laugh and have a great time when it’s with friends, but when it’s a person performing on stage, I tend to analyse the jokes than really get into it. 

imo, I’m clearly just fucked in the head.
