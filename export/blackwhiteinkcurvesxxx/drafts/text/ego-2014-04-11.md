When the trauma is high, people like to hide behind themselves in order to cope with the pain. They like to build alter-egos, sudden identities, anything to get away from the hurt. I used to talk to myself a lot as a kid because I had no friends. Rather simple.

Consider this notion and I think it’s something which may rock your paradigm: Ego is a substitute for low self-esteem. Think about it. If you’re already happy with who you are, why the need for fashion? Why should you ever need to sell yourself or recede? If you naturally have self-esteem, you don’t worry about what people think about you. In fact, you have no worries at all; you simply exist. Functioning, desirable, smutt.
