If you could just see the way she smiles; feel the way she touches. If you could breathe her every breath and face her every challenge. Then you may know the essence of beauty. You may charm the heart that never stops beating.

Happiness must come from within, first and foremost. If you are not happy with yourself, then you cannot expect to be happy with anyone else. 

Your goal in life is to be happy about everything.
