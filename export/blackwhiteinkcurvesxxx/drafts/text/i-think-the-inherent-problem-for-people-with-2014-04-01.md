I think the inherent problem for people with depression and other forms of delusion (though really, depression is just a consequence of delusion) is the fact that they generally don’t have an understanding of the how the belief system works. 

I mean, how are you supposed to solve an algebra equation if you don’t know what those silly symbols on the page represent?

Of course, the next best thing people have is “conventional wisdom” to extrapolate on their infinite struggle into realms and realms of haste. 

If it’s one thing I can preach, it’s that you should never give up your autonomy as a person. Do not outsource the way you think to anyone, because everything is wrong. Yes, you are wrong, I am wrong and this is the whole point of being a skeptic. You understand the dynamics of nature and you either choose to work with it or against it. Anyway, that’s a vague tangent.
