Today hasn’t been a great day for me, though the tune plays on. I guess I’m still in a state of shock. At the very least, I haven’t touched myself as that’s the usual go to when dopamine registers low. 

I can’t say I really know how I feel

Even though it wasn’t a messy break up, because we had a very open and honest relationship, it doesn’t make the pain any less.
