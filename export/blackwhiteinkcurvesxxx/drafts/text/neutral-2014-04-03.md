I think it’s important to be neutral in your bias, because outcomes are unpredictable. It also gives you flexibility in your opinion.

In this regard, I don’t mind it when people don’t like me for who I am or what I create. I think discrimination is healthy, be it against gender. 

Some people just don’t like pussy. That’s cool. I’m not gonna force a dude who doesn’t like pussy, into liking pussy. You could easily say the same thing for gender, foods, race, you name it. It don’t matter. It’s just personal preference and there’s no particular right or wrong. 

I write a lot about themes of rape and conceptual disaster, which may turn some people off. I encourage it. I think it’s important to encourage people to be who they are and that shouldn’t affect you. 

People get offended when other people get affected, because they cannot see things from their point of view. Very few people are open minded. You cannot empathise with racism, murder. 

I’m asking you to agree with it. I’m asking you to accept the reality for what it is. The problem is that people are affected by said reality and so they have an emotional attachment to their trauma. They have no yet come to terms with the false perception in their head. They suffer.
