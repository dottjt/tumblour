I suppose an important distinction to make is that I don’t need to have sex. That it doesn’t not comprise of my well-being and more. 

One of the great insecurities I have in my mind is that I haven’t had enough sex in my life. It makes me feel inadequate.

The problem with this line of thinking, is that unless if I accept myself for who I am, I’m never going to.

The first time I had sex was downright terrible. In fact, she never even wanted to do it and she was pressured into it. The second time was with the same girl and that was even worse, because she was adamant she didn’t want to do it, but she did anyway.
