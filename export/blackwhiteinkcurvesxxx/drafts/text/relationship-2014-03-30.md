Sah, I’m back with the babe and all is well and flourishing n’ all that shit. The basic premise I’ve taken away from this, is that I take her for granted and as time went along, managed to create my own non-existence of doubts and foolery as to how I feel about her.

The mind is a very powerful thing. It’s stupid, because nothing had ever changed between us, yet for some reason in my mind, I assumed that my love was becoming less and less, when it really hadn’t. Humans are just silly creatures. Also, I had some fairly vivid dreams about my ex, which didn’t help. 

However I think the problem with love, is that by nature alone, the damn thing is simple and flowing, which is to say that any hint of potential chemistry between two lovers, bares no resistance to it’s name. 

Pretentious douchery.

What I mean to say is that love is difficult to find initially, however it almost just “happens” naturally when you do find it and you it’s easy to take that chemistry for granted.

All it really took was a small time apart (not even a day) and I missed her so much and I realised how much she really meant to me.
