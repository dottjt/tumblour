Time moves far too slowly for this traveler. 

So much life. So little FUCKING CRAMMING INTO THIS PITILESS SPACE OF A BULL-FUCKING-SHIT.

No. No. These words lie. Fuck, but they sure are hell PAINT a wonderful picture for the children watching futures surpass them. Just to think, that in a few short moments (oh yes, you will understand, just as your ancestors have before them) that you’ll be DEAD.

Listen buddy, no one wants to die, but I mean, if it ain’t war of disease, consider yourself pretty lucky. YOU ARE GOING TO DIE IN A FEW MOMENTS. Time transcends your ability to think and bam!

There you are. On your death bed. Of course, kid yourselves now. Don’t think about death my children. Well, you’ll be DEAD and that’s AAAAGES away. 

Of course, logic is timeless so please, sing yourself into life as the bombs drop around you and kill a few more million.M may the afterlife carry you fourth where your kids dare not go. 

I mean, we’re so surrounded by peace and opportunity and GOOD TIMES, but we just gotta sit back and bitch the bitch. 

All this worry. All this hate. Yet I want you to understand dear sir/madam, as you sit your oh-so-lovely chair (perhaps even a bed for god knows reason) you are experiencing life as has never been experienced before. It ain’t about the emotions you silly fucker. It’s about the privilege. 

You sit in the chair, just so you can wilt away into a misconduct of gossip and lies. 

I think I’m just a bundle of terrible person.
