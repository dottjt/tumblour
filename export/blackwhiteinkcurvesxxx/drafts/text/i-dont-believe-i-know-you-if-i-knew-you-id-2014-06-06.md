I don’t believe I know you. If I knew you, I’d give you a great big hug and smash your head against a brick wall; revealing what can only be described as an opportunity and a tragedy, rolled inconceivably into one. There is your wallet, draped neatly within the blood of your weak successor. Pour soul, the queen desires no such more violence in this house of READE. You’re a mess; tomorrow’s jelly. 

A dry figure coasts mysteriously into a chamber of rolled emphatic. Your bitch eyes twirl into a furried mess. It’s your world sucker.

What the fuck about it?
