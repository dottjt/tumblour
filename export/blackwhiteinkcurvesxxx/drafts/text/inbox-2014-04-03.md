Well well now, my pretty little broad in the red dress of your desires; no point obscuring the illusion of our titty little espionage into packets of identity and senile provocation. In a world of possibility, let us hone our focus onto the conceptual lust that hope reverberates. In other words, are you hopeful that you know me? After all, these are the words which speak for themselves, be they deceiving as the attention borne in your eyes.

[Sorry for the prose. Any opportunity to express grammar is a moment unfortunately abused.]

It’s all just a sea of grammar to me, regardless of the context. The words don't like to discriminate against the imagination of unlimited possibility. I’m just a writer. I paint all sorts of pictures, yet it doesn’t make them anymore real, either in my imagination, nor per reality.
