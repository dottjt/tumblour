Girls with attitude:

a) No, I’m not interested in fucking you. Sex is a byproduct of chemistry, not some hollow event on my calendar. 

b) I don’t care for attitude and bitchiness. It is a complete waste of my time and effort.

c) I don’t buy into image, because It’s one big fucking mirage. I don’t care what you wear or how you dress yourself, without a personality I can simplify you down to the vagina on your body. 

d) It’s not going to waste my time on someone who is inherently shit. I have many people in my life who genuinely care about me, who are judgmental and warped up in their own ego. 

Though really, I don’t think it’s fair to blame anyone for the way they are. People are a simple product of their environment. Be it an abusive father or perhaps a negative experienced with another guy. Go figure.
