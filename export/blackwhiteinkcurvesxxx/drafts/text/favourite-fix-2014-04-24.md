I want to take the time to acknowledge my favourite band in the whole entire world: Artist vs. Poet

Most people haven’t heard them, yet I think they’re the most fantastic band ever. I love their music dearly. 

I listen to their album favourite fix multiple times a day, from start to finish.

They’re a power pop / pop punk band which rose prominence with the likes of The Friday Night Boys, Cute is what we aim for, Mercy Mercedes etc. Yes, it’s quite possible that I listen to 14 year old girl music.
