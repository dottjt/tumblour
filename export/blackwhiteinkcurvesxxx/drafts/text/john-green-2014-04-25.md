I have a general distaste towards John Green literature. His writing style is just really, really dull. Thereâ€™s no conceptual complexity in the way he writes. It reads like a terrible teenage novel. The same goes for Sylvia Path. Oh god, The Bell Jar it was simply atrocious. I prefer authors from the beat generation, particularly William S. Burroughs. That man knew how to write, because he was a true arbiter of knowledge. Not some faux emotional advocate (admittedly Path was fucked in the head, but her literary style garners no attention to my eyes). 

I mean, admittedly his books are written for a younger audience, but I just cannot fathom the brain cells dying within my vicinity. I like literature that challenges me. Forces me complete intellectual agony, as I scavenge for my dictionary so I figure out the precise banality of medical prose.
