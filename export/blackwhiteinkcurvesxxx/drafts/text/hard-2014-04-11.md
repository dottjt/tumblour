So, as they say in American Psycho (supposedly read, considering it’s taken from the book) I have a hardbody. I’m toned and muscular, especially now that I’m working out everyday to deal with the pain and it’s something I find incredibly odd.

Oh gee, this is going to sound so anorexic, but I feel fat. Not because I am fat, hardly. Only because I used to be fat growing up, so that’s the mentality I grew up with.

I’m not a huge fan of my muscles. I mean, they’re great, but I only do it because I want to get healthy. I’m a writer and I don’t paint that stereotype very well.

Fuck em’. I’m gonna get massive and I’m going to get all sorts of girls. Ahhhh, probably not. I don’t really want to attract the stunning girls; they generally got no mental stimulus for me. I’m either one of a few things; either we have a similar sense of humor and we can just bounce off each other or you’re incredibly intelligent and we can talk about concepts forever, WHICH if is true, would also suggest that your humor would be unlimited. All theory.
