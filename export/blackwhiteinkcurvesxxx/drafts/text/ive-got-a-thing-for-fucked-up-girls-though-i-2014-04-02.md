I’ve got a thing for fucked up girls, though I suppose that’s kinda normal since I’m also fucked up. Well, I don’t think I’m entirely fucked up. In a sense, I feel a lot of it is fabricated aka my personality. Through out high school I would talk to myself a lot and do a lot of stupid voices and I feel like my personality has retained that wackiness to me. 

I’m incredibly conservative by many measures (I would never dream of getting a tattoo or a piercing) and if you saw me on the street, you wouldn’t think twice about who I was.

It has more to with who I am as a person.

I often say fucked up things in public and I’m not afraid to talk about drugs or those incredibly taboo subjects like arson or whatever. I just don’t care. I’m not afraid to steal or to be bad-ass. I’ll take drugs in the city and I remember once I did a whole bunch of acid and I walked around the city and it was swell. 

I like girls who aren’t afraid to try different things. Fuck it, I’ll push you against the wall and start making out and man, you can totally give me a blow job in public like it’s no big deal. I’m sure we could make it worse.
