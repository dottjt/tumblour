Three weeks. Jesus. That’s a long time when you really think about it, though perhaps I shouldn’t think about it too much. I was on the verge of relapsing earlier. 

I was going to do it today. I really was, though I didn’t. Thank you to the girl who talked me out of it.

I’ve realised what the problem is and why I’m having all these sexual frustrations again.

It’s that I started watching porn again.

Up until that point, everything was fine. I had no real urges to masturbate. It’s the porn that hooks you.

Porn is amazing.

I just need to get laid. I really don’t care at this point. I think my mind is going to explode.
