I made a very, very poor decision yesterday and I have the need to share it with everyone.

No, I didn’t orgasm.

Thank god.

I couldn’t stop watching porn and masturbating all day. I was ridiculously horny all day and it was terrible. Though it gets worse.

I was so desperate for sex that I hooked up with a girl over tumblr who I didn’t even like. I didn’t find her physically attractive. Her intelligence didn’t do anything for me.

I’m an idiot.

Now I realise that I want to save it for someone special. Someone who I care about.

Don’t get me wrong. I sold it as a casual hook up and

She’s not a bad person. She really isn’t, but I feel terrible for playing her. She deserves better. Someone like her, not some ravaging idiot.

I think that’s the thing with my kinds of girls. They know how to play back and bite back. Then what happens, is that when you realise you’re both an equal threat to each other, that’s the moment in which romance sparks.
