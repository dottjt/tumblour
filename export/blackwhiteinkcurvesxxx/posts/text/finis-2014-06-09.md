I’ve pretty much realised that weed and sleep are two things sustaining my existence at this very moment in time. I’m going to finish this damn research essay, I’m going to smoke some weed and then proceed to sleep. 

I’ve been rather liberal with my money lately. Nothing really has any purpose or meaning anymore, so why not go a little crazy? I’ve been buying a heap of a snacks and I pretty much just buy as much food as I can whenever I’m out. In fact, I’ve basically been sustaining myself on junk food, in particular marshmallows and bananas. I’m usually the kind of person who saves their money down to the meticulous detail, but what of it sucker!? 

As you can tell, exhibit A is overwhelmed by happiness. Exhibit B on the other hand, has killed himself and it’s a real shame no one’s noticed his dead body blocking the driveway. Oh well.
