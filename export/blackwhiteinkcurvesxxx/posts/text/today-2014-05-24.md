Today’s been great. 

I think I’ve come to terms with being single, at least for the time being. 

I personally can judge my level of happiness by the amount of self-control and focus I have. I don’t feel bogged down or hopeless. It’s not some kind of false hope holding me up; it’s a real sense of unbridled future.

I’m not 100% where I was a few days ago prior to the breakdown, however I at least have some logic in me NOT to feel terrible. 

You know, it’s kinda cool that I’m single. It means I get to flirt with whoever I want and I’m just free to roam in the world as I see forth. I’m reading this book on seduction and it’s amazing. It literally explains the stereotypes of women perfectly and how to approach all the different types of women. 

Last night this girl messaged me with the most amazing piece of insight: "It’s pretty bold to want anything from another person. We ask so much of others.“

Something struck me when I read that. I think she’s right. It’s so incredibly selfish to expect another person to pry you from your own insecurity. I guess we all have a lot of learn. 

Everything will be just fine.
