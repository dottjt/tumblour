Dear world,

You’re not very kind to me. You abuse me. You hurt me. You call me silly names. Yet ultimately it’s myself who’s responsible for my own life. I sold myself the idea. I sold it so fucking well and I feel like I’ve made a complete mockery of myself. I sold our life together as the ultimate package. I did. I really did. I sold it as something brilliant. Something which cannot be matched, even though ideas are very simple constructs.

The idea is a very complete thing. It’s concrete. It’s set in notion, even before anything has taken place. It’s hope. You sell yourself hope, because it’s all you really have when you’re desperate to feel enlightened. It doesn’t make you feel any more human or capable, but it’s something.

It’s an elaborate scheme so you can pretend to feel again. One great big joke for you to laugh at, only the realise that the punchline revolves around your entire existence. It’s now up to myself to discover the cracks in this scheme and expose the lies for what they are. It’s a difficult task, otherwise the scheme would have never sustained itself in the first place.

I can feel the self-doubt already. What did I do wrong? How could I possibly deserve this? I tried my best. I really did. Though none this really matters. It’s not the kind of perspective you truly deserve. 

I deserve love.

I know this experience will make me stronger. I will not give into orgasm. I’ve made it 23 days to get to this point, so I’m not going to throw in the towel that easily.

Hope is not my friend. It doesn’t speak my language. It doesn’t know my name. It simply exists to maintain the delusion of my existence.

[Side note: The pasta I’m eating tastes like cigarettes.]

I feel terrible; like I’ve died. Though death is just an opportunity for life. It’s the cycle which keeps us going.

Sincerely,

Me.
