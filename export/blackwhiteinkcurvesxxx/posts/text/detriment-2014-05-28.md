When I think about it, growing up in a privileged society is one of life’s biggest detriments. It’s a double-edged sword of sorts, I suppose. 

I was watching this documentary on China and you have couples who literally only have the opportunity to see each other for a few hours a week, because they’re so busy working and surviving under the conditions of a few dollars a day.

Couples who literally only get to see their children for a few days of the year, because the conditions under which they must survive and seek opportunity.

I guess it comes down to this search for life’s meaning and how you best express yourself under it’s circumstances. For these parents, they can’t hug their children. They can’t be there to tell them how much they care.

That must be crushing, yet is this a false standard I’m setting for myself? 

Here I am, this idealist fucker who wants everything in the world, at my doorstep, right here, right now. I mean, everyone has got everything, right? 

Abundance is a disease of sorts.

Perhaps that’s why I like to write in such quantity; it’s a pretentious representation of society. So full of potential, yet so devoid of meaning. Squander the meaning until your heart spills no.
