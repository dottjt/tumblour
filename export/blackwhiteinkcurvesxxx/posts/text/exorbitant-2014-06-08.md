Why, someone PLEASE stab me and hold me tight, sweet flutter of god, so treacherous in lies, so quaint in it’s mercy, we run to life! Be gone! Forever disappear into enumerated reality, for my chalice lacks fury to penetrate thy name!

Pedantic. Infuriating. Delirious. Reprimand. Incisive. Orthopedic. Lazy. Functionless. Tripe. Whore. 

These are the false prophets you worship! You’ll be damned for thy sins~!

Well, perhaps not. 

I woke up at 12:46AM today. Fantastic little man. I don’t care, thank you, thank you.

Now please fuck off.

Here I am at Monash University. It’s 2:46PM and not an ounce of work has been accomplished, let alone attempted. Don’t worry Dear Sire! I have faith in my own ability to FUCK UP.

I haven’t even eaten any food yet, as of today, and since it’s a Sunday, all the shops are closed with exception this one small cafeteria featuring ridiculously overpriced garbage. They would only take cash and when I asked dearly where the nearest ATM was, was announced some half-the-fucking-campus away. 

Well suck my dick bitch, because you just lost a customer. 

Anyway, that’s okay. It just means I get to eat later.

I’ve literally been eating noting but junk these past few yesteryear’s. Oh boy, all those bags of marshmallows, I couldn’t even fathom the damage THEY’RE doing to my humble soul.

It’s funny though, because prior to this slump, I took advantage of the fact that I was happy and worked out BIG TIME. So it doesn’t matter how many calories or children I eat, my metabolism just absorbs the toxic goodness and reciprocates dear love
