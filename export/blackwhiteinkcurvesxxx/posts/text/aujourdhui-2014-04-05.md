The hardest thing about undergoing trauma, is rectifying your bias in a way that returns your opinion into a state of love and acceptance. At one point in your life, prior to whatever trauma you experienced, it was quite possible that you didn’t have a hatred for men or a complete disdain for society. It’s certainly a lot harder for people who haven’t yet experienced love from the outset to return to an equilibrium, so they’re naturally skeptical towards the cause. 

I don’t believe in changing my opinion or outlook on something, simply because of a traumatic experience. All that does is further distort reality of it’s potential. You cannot be cynical and have an open mind at the same time.

I’ve had a fair few relationships not turn out so well; some ending poorly beyond words. Depression. Worthlessness. Fair enough. However no matter what, I’m going to keep trying to find the right person who can make me happy, until I experience the love I deserve. I’m going to fight for my right to experience love, even if it means experiencing all the hate in the world.

Because I am not a cynic. I am a fighter. 

If you give up on the potential of life and demonise love (which most people do not realise they’re doing, because they’re so caught up in their own world of hate), simply because of a few bad experiences, you are truly denying yourself a life of happiness.

It means you will always be shrouded by hate and skepticism. You will end up hollow and decrepit, like the very people you so fear. 

I’m willing to risk my emotions and their counterparts, even if it means destroying who I am as a person; something which I’m all too familiar with. Even if it means experiencing a trauma so terrible, that I have to completely destroy and rediscover my identity in order to keep going forward. Yes, I have done it before and I will do it again.

Without love, you do not live and that is what scares me most.

I will live. I will not fear.

I will love.
