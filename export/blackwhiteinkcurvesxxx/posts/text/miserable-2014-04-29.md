I’m miserable as hell.

That kind of miserable where you give up all hope and admit you’re a big fat phony. Hello world, I’m a broken man and I can barely tie my own shoelaces, let alone find a girl worth loving.

I was at work and I was experiencing that kind of self-doubt, self-hate, self-criticism that had me delusionally talking to myself at every intersection of my existence. Funny talk. Impersonations. General insanity. Otherwise, I would’ve suffered a complete mental breakdown at work and oh no, the modern day consumer doesn’t approve of heart break as an institutional product.

Gotta keep that mind rolling or the tune may stop to trip you up into a fatal DEATH.*ahem*

In the meantime, I’ve resorted to masturbating myself to death; a common ailment to the exhaustion of my own inertia. I figure that if I can make myself feel more dull than the pain of being dull, then perhaps my reality will break out into a new epiphany of flowers and rainbows. I’d totally fuck a rainbow right now.

This is a race to the bottom and I’m be happy to come last.

Mostly however, I murmur to myself in Cockney Latin as to how life hates me and how I hate it. It’s not my friend. It doesn’t want to hold my hand; it only wants to shoot me in the kneecaps and piss on my doorstep. Fuck you. Whore.

If you need me, I’ll be at Mcdonalds ordering some life into my colon. I may even buy a pouch of tobacco and take up smoking.

I’m not even joking.
