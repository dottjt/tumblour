Hi. 

Would like to try on my personality? Don’t worry. It doesn’t bite and it fits a multitude of personal arrogance, ranging from hysteria to downright candy-core.

Have my smile! Take my laughter! Don’t forget all those quirky mannerisms you sucker! Quaint bastard. I’ll have him choking in no time. 

Well.

I hate to say it, but guess what dipshit!? It looks like somebody here fucked up. 

I swear. Don’t you fucking. 

One more time soldier and I’ll have my hand so far up your ass you’ll shit due diligence.

That mirror. Thy honor, fucker.

It’s got your face on it and your face is by far, the worst fucking thing I’ve attempted since the holocaust.

You a victim buddy? You a Jew hater, sir?

SHALL I ARREST YOU DEAR DEGENERATE!?

“Your feint smile smears a pitiful grey, sliding along reality like a delicate lie on the tip of your asinine tongue.”

I want to kick your fucking head in. 

Don’t touch me. Don’t you dare try to mimic my self-worth, you little shit, because you can’t do SHIT with those stupid fucking hands.

Recruits. 

Ah yes, if you look closely, there’s a tracer leading towards… your dumb fucking skull. 

You lost senior. 

Senior don’t loose.
