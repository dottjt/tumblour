Cycles are addictive. Heart break is one of them.

I wouldn’t say I’m obsessed with the ups and downs, but I can see why people take hard drugs.

I love the feeling of being completely battered, because it means I need to exceed myself. I need to push myself. Depression is a challenge. It gives life meaning. Failure is not a constant.

Fuck her.

I still work out every day. I still write well. I’m not going to let another person’s problems affect the way I feel about myself. I’m not going to take her life personally. I may be vulnerable, but that doesn’t make me a loser. 

Grow or die.

I’ll say it one thousand times if I have to.

HA.

I’ll be begging at her heels by tonight. An emotional wreck by tomorrow. I only just went through this a mere month ago. I know exactly what to expect; though that doesn’t make me any less ill-prepared. The past few days have been denial. Now I’m possibly at the bargaining/anger stage. 

Probably still in denial. I keep checking my followers list, in case I’ve just gone crazy and she’s still there.

You think she’s scared. I’m absolutely terrified.

Welcome to my life.
