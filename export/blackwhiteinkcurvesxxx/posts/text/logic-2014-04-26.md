As much as I’d like to write and entertain the logic within my own mind, it may seem that my body is in a collective orchestra of pain and agony. I decided to throw a house party last night and deary me, I’ve been trying to write about it through the words, words, words, words, fuck these words, but I just cannot be fucked. Fucking words. In a few moments, I will be putting a metaphorical bullet through these runny tears that speak volumes OF eyes (oh, fuck you viscosity), in the hope that foolish sentiment be avoided in such a quantity, that it shall be enough to lightly tread the excess of multiple rounds; grain-based luxury.

I need comfort.

Fun bags.

I want to touch some fun bags, right now.

Actually, I think I might head down to subway and gorge myself silly.

I. Can’t. Help. Myself. You. Bitch.
