I think I’m generally frustrated with life because I believe myself to be a fairly decent guy and in thinking that, am deluded to think that I’m entitled to my own ideals and desires.

It’s a very dangerous mode of arrogance.

I’m not bad looking. I work out. I’m intelligent. I have charm. I have grammatical technique; talent. I’m immense projection of knowledge; a genuine concern for others.

I try my best to make people feel special. et al. 

Yet I feel that all I get in return is dirt and I know it’s an incredibly narrow-minded way of thinking that is not even vaguely true, however I’m also highly insecure. Deal with it.

I feel entitled. Not grateful. That is the real pain in my heart. In fact, I wrote about this before. I have an image of perfection of who I should be in my mind, that I cannot yet satisfy. It is not unconditional an love for life; it is a strict requirement I have created of myself. I am the mascot for delusion.

I fight and fight and fight and when you lose enough fights, the whole thing begins to smell of scam. The floor is rigged with oil slick and I want out. However I’m not willing to give up. I’m not going to jump ship, simply because it’s more convenient to settle for less. 

I’m not going to settle for anything less than my own pure happiness.

To me it’s a rigged game of chance. That in part is what makes the whole thing so addictive.

You can break me, cheat me, hurt me, bring me down, spit on my face, torture me, physically kill me… however I can promise you one thing.

You will never change my desire to be happy.
