Oh. mah gawd. I’m super silly happy :3

So the girl I have feelings for decided to make a kik account, just so we could talk last night. We ended up chatting for 4 hours straight until 4:30am and she makes me so happy :)

I was incredibly nervous in the beginning and she said she was as well, though she was certainly more composed than me. I could barely communicate my thoughts. Every single emotion and feeling rushed through my body like a tyrant of futile agitation, though I was incredibly happy at the same time. I didn’t know what to say and I was too scared to say anything, in case she would be offended. I was like an awkward teenager on prom night. It was the kind of situation where I’d been completely happy to just stare into the beauty of her eyes and not worry about the communication flowing from my lips. I was in complete awe at her presence, like an organ dripping from my face. Oh wait, that is my face.

I couldn’t quite comprehend anything at the time.

I’m 99% certain it’s going to be a relationship at this point. I like her a lot and I think she likes me as well. I feel there’s still so much to discover about her and each other! I can’t wait to take cute selfies together and go on romantic dates and be cute in bed while we snuggle and watch a movie, before making out and getting steamy from the boredom of watching Frozen for the fifth time that day :3 Just the thought of being with her makes me feel weak. I feel I know a lot about her life (4 hours of introductory conversation worth), but I still don’t know what she looks like or what her voice sounds like, but I already love her for who she is and the words she can produce.

I think I’m going to drop dead from excitement :) I can’t wait to meet her in person and touch her face n’ stuff :D

One of the conditions however, is that there cannot be any sex until marriage (if that ever happens), which I’m actually quite happy with. Mind you, this includes everything but penetration, so it doesn’t mean we can’t be naughty and oh, I plan on being naughty. Also, I’m refraining from orgasm for the time being anyway, so it’s almost perfect. 

One of the things I noticed in my last relationship, was that we were so much happier before we started having sex and orgasming. So much so that we intended on stopping, but then she found another guy and we broke up. She’d always be really insecure the day after and I’d love her less and not be so infatuated with her. You know that feeling after sex when you just want to be alone? That’s the kind of stuff I’m talking about. When you don’t orgasm, you just want to be together all the time and cuddle. Classic teenage love. I’ve read a lot of literature into it and I’m happy to stop, just as I have. In fact, orgasm is the primary motivator for failed marriages.

Fuck.

Get home you fat whore and talk to me or I’ll cut yaaaa`! TALK TO ME OR I’LL GO LOCO AND KILLS EVERYONE ON TUMBLR BRO WITH MY TUMBLR SKILLZ. U BEEN WARNED.

As you can tell, I plan on being the insecure, violently aggressive type of boyfriend.
