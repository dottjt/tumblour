Hey bro, why don’t you touch me?

Yeah, like touch me with those hands of yours.

Now, listen here you little fuck, will you please just touch me and get this over and done with?

I know you want to.

Don’t you dare fucking tell me that you don’t want it to happen, because I do.

I won’t say it again. 

Oh, but… but you little bitch.

I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to. 

It’s just… don’t you fucking smirk.

Did you fucking just smirk at me? 

I know, I know. 

I’m a prick.

I never intended on saying all those things. It just… happened. You know? 

Well well, so that’s how it is. Fuck.

You

Bitch.

I don’t need to take your shit any more. I’ve got dignity. I’ve got self-respect. I’ve got power and control. 

God damn it.

PS: So, I was writing this rhetoric and now note: I’m not specifying gender in any case, which if you want to go into the whole transgender thing, is virtually impossible to define nowadays. For all we know, the person speaking may be delusional and talking to no one but himself. Yet even so, I couldn’t help but think that people in most cases would assume that this scenario projects an inherently misogynist tone and is referring to a man abusing a woman. Statistically, yes. 

But I’m not going to be demonized for something I’ve never done.
