I’m incredibly fragile, but I do quite well to protect myself. I put on an amazing show and my ego speaks deep, but the moment the illusion goes, it really falls through. I usually verge on breaking down whenever I see a cute couple. 

I was talking to a girl earlier and she said that she’d been in a few committed relationships and I asked her if she ever felt insecure when she was single? 

She said no. 

Basically the theory I came up with, is that capable guys feel insecure about not having someone, because they feel entitled to have a girl. Whereas capable girls don’t feel insecure because they know they’ve got it and they literally just have to wait for a guy to sweep them off their feet. 

Then incapable girls feel insecure because they feel like a guy will never approach them and incapable guys aren’t insecure, because they just don’t care.

I dunno. Probably bullshit. 

Honestly not in the mood to write at all. I think I’d rather sit and pretend I’m happy.
