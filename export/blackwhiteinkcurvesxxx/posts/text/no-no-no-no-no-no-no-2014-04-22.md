I feel heart broken.

I know, it’s silly. I’m silly. I can’t help the way I feel. 

She still hasn’t responded and I think she’s decided to let me go and it absolutely tears my heart apart to think about it. You know that deep pain you get inside your heart after a break up? Yep. That’s the one. 

The last post she made on her tumblr (and no, it wasn’t a reblog) was this Sex in the City image set and it’s freaking me out. 

It’s basically the main girl holding up a sticky note against the window of a car saying: 

“I’m sorry.

I can’t.

Please don’t hate me.”

I’ve been a wreck since getting back from work. I went to McDonalds earlier so I could drown my sorrows and I bought home some ingredients so I can comfort eat a bunch of macaroni and cheese I know how to cook. I hope I eat enough food so that it kills me. Oh and to top it off, my plastic bag with all the ingredients inside broke before I got home, so I had to run home, get plastic bags and come back to pick them up. *sigh*

I’m freaking out because this exact same thing has happened to me before, where the girl just completely disappeared from my life without warning.

I haven’t done anything wrong. I really haven’t. Oh please. 

I could just be over-reacting. I feel sick. I want to die.

There’s sad.

Then there’s “the girl who you thought was the one, may be ignoring you because fuck, fuck ufkc” sad.

I should probably get to cooking that macaroni. Ugh, though I’m so anxious, nothing is really going to help. Fuck me.

Yes. So I guess the temporary euphoria was great while it lasted. Though I guess if you enjoyed some of my more depressive writings, now’s a great time to sit back and poke fun at the big bear in the room.

Crying is in order :( :( :( :( :(
