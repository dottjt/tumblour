“I HAVE a boyfriend.”

“This is MY girlfriend.”

When fraud is the status quo, possession is the law. We humans are awfully obsessed with ownership. We gotta have it, otherwise we’re miserable sods of shit. 

It’s interesting to note how radically similar we are as people, both before and after break ups. My face is still attached to my body. My house and it’s subsiding utilities, all remain within walking pace.

I think to a large extent this idea of comfort is being sold to us, at a time when personal dependency now lies within the palm of another hand. The other person makes us feel happy, because of the narrative we’re willing to tell ourselves, as an acceptable response towards our own dispatched reality.

You are the arbiter of your own self-hatred and despise. 

I don’t think I’ve ever asked anyone if they’d like to HAVE some of MY happiness. Feelings can’t be bought, yet here we are, in possession of another human being, if not by name, just so we can suck the exclusivity out of other people’s minds.

If you want to take things a step further, no one truly owns anything. There is nature and then there is the ecosystem of your own consciousness, as it tries to fuck you out of decency and fervor. 

“Oh, so you don’t HAVE a girlfriend? That’s a real shame, because I HAVE a girlfriend. You know, we talk about how amazing everything is ALL the time and it’s the most fabulous thing EVER.”

Fuck you. I hope you drown and burn. 

…just like I am now, for the very false hope I perpetrate ;)

So yes, I have no one to blame but myself. I’m a self-fulfilling prophecy, barely holding my own neck down to the blade which hopes to relieve me of my burden.

Of course, that’s part of the allure. My life my not be full of glamour and hoes waiting to bang me outside of my front door, but when I look back at these words with an accomplished smile, I’ll be sure as hell to lament at the amount of life I had to give.

I want to explode with happiness.
