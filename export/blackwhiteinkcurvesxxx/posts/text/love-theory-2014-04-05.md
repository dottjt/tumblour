I just came up with a theory about love that I hope makes sense, though clearly I’m just stoooopid. 

I don’t have any girls in my life anymore and I’m feeling a little insecure at the moment, though I just broke up with my ex this morning, so that’s to be expected. I’m by no means destructive or in a state of overwhelming sadness, but reality is a little mellow by anyone’s standards. 

Anyway, for some reason I was thinking about okcupid I decided to go through the Melbourne tag and look up the girls on there and I was kinda impressed with what I saw. Then it occurred to me that I should probably try and find girls who are like me; not just any typical girl who’s willing to be with me, otherwise the same thing will happen again and that’s going to equate to even more heartbreak. 

Of course, people get worried they’re not going to find anyone and that they’re going to be alone for the rest of their life. Then it occurred to me that this kind of thinking is stupid, because if there is truly someone like you out there, assuming that everyone is highly individualised, then irregardless of whether they’re actively seeking partners or not, chances are that you will end up together based upon the fact that there are few very similar people out there, at least if they were to be similar to me.

What I mean to say, is that even if your ideal partner does date a whole of people, they’re probably not going to culminate into successful relationships because of their lack in difference. This means, hopefully, that they’re going to be available to you throughout most your life, assuming you ever find them. Which, if your expressions are similar, is likely.

The irrational mind of a desperate man. If you need me, I’ll be grating my face against the wall.
