Hi.

It’s not easy.

I was having a panic attack earlier, so I decided to meditate for 10 minutes and now I’m in a state of vivid semblance; my own fatal misdemeanor breathes heavily upon my soul.

Pity these words you arsehole. 

No one wants to fuck me. No one wants to love me. All I really have are these words, so please, enjoy them as I spill my guts all over the porcelain.

I woke up to a severe depression this morning and it’s remained thus since. I know it’s because of the rubbish sleep I had last night, but whatever.

It’s hard to describe what depression feels like. I would say it’s this unbearable sadness that encompasses you every living second. It’s unbearable; it’s constant. There’s no way of dealing with it, no way of coping. You continue to live your life in hope that it doesn’t drive you insane.

I guess one thing that helps me get through my day is humor. I spent a lot of today acting, playing characters, doing stupid voices, doing stand up comedy to myself etc. It’s distracting, but it’s also legitimately entertaining. 

Of course, eventually it tires you and you become what I call “zombie depressed.” It’s like being stoned, but in a non-fun way.

Meh. 

Today has been difficult, but I gave it my best and I made a lot of good choices, so I’m not going to beat myself up.

I have a standing desk. I literally stand all day and read/learn. I refuse to sit, even if im eating. I’ve been eating super paleo healthy. Zero sugar. Zero junk. Lots of vegetables. No drugs, not even caffeine. I’ve been going to bed early and waking up early. 

Good sleep is so important for combating depression, you better believe it. 

I’m meditating and reading books on helping my depression. I’m exercising. By anyone’s standards, I’m doing quite well for myself.

Today is day four in my recovery effort (except for weed, which has been two days since I last toked) and I aim to make these changes permanent.

That’s precisely the challenge.

I wonder to what extent this is insecurity vs addiction? Maybe once I’ve completely desensitised my mind, I’ll no longer be depressed? 

Time will tell, but I’m commited.
