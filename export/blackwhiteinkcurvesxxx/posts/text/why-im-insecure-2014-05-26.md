I think I know why my first relationship failed. 

Put simply, I have two predominant love languages: Touch and affirmation. Basically, I like to be held while being told I’m special. Simple. It makes me feel loved. For some people it’s receiving gifts. For others it’s spending quality time together. The last one is an act of service.

Now, I don’t think there was anything wrong with our personalities (sure, there were differences, but it worked). In fact, I think that’s why I got so depressed. I didn’t want to see it go.

Of course, the problem was that it was long distance (so there was no touch) and she was in no place to love (so no affirmation). There was certainly affirmation in the beginning, but once it ceased, that’s when things began to tear apart. 

So I felt like I was receiving no love from her. Did that mean she didn’t love me? Not necessarily. Does that make her a bad person? Not at all.

So in the aftermath, that made me feel incredibly insecure. I still desired her love more than anything, but I simply couldn’t have it. I was crushed. 

The end.
