I don’t like these cherry words; these insolent pieces of pie. They crumble in my hand like a bad cockney poem, awaiting disaster as the town whore of reciprocation. They speak under the pretense of lust and desire, when all sentiment is being converted at breakneck speed into sift and swallow - the purity unseen since pretense. It approaches you wisely; breaking conception down into a thousand different songs, each playing an improvised tune of disgust and madness. The words follow suit. 

You can’t quite place your finger on it, as it sits diligently on your shame in waiting. It does not hunt you down, for you are already in the crosshairs; shoot me down you fucker. The trigger will be another five fifty, though perhaps an extra ten dollars in real terms. 

Gently now. I think I’ll let the money speak for itself.
