Let me put into perspective for you, what I’m going through and how you can possibly relate.

Imagine waking up one day to find out that your house is gone; your computer missing along with all of the data you’ve collected over the years. All the things you had in your bedroom; completely evaporated. So much so that you do not own anything. Your family is not to be seen. You will never see them again. In fact, all you have is your physical body and that’s all you have to carry to your grave; the very existence you abhor. A very pale sort of loneliness.

Now imagine that instead of these tangible possessions, they are in fact emotional possessions. That’s what my girlfriend meant to me; the emotional totality that provided complete emotional stability in my life. She was my only emotional possession and now it’s gone. My entire sense of self-esteem and now it’s gone.

All of it.

Imagine having to come to terms with the fact that you have nothing in your life. Nada. It’s all gone.

I hope you now understand what I’m going through and how I feel.
