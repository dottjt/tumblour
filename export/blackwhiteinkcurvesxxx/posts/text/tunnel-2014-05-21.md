Today has been amazing.

I’ve displayed so much focus like you cannot imagine. 

Since waking up, I’ve literally done nothing but read books all day and it’s the best thing ever. It’s just fun! 

I don’t know how people can remain cynical; remain being the key word. I’m so glad I saw the light at the end of the tunnel. 

I’m no longer scared of myself and it just makes me so happy ^_^
