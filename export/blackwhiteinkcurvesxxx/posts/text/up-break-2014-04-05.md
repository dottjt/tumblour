So uhhhh, there was a lot of crying this morning, however everything is fine now. Basically the girl who I was with for two months, told me she loved another guy and it was very emotional and sad for me. Don’t get me wrong, I’m entirely happy for her and I wish her the best of luck, but it’s still tragic none-the-less. Still, I’m so incredibly proud of who she is and what she’s achieved in our two short months together
