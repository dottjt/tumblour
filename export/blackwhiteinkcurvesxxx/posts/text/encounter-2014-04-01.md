I’m feeling kinda fucked, but that’s okay. 

So my mum is having some Buddhist event in the backyard and she does it every week and I suppose it’s important to her yadayadayada. Anyway, she needed me to get three items: a strawberry, a cheesy roll and a muffin… aaaaaaand it didn’t quite work out as planned.

I live really close to the shops, so it shouldn’t have been an issue. However I’d decided to take a bus to the train station first, just so I could pick up my bike and return it home. 

[Co-incidentally, I happen to find a strawberry at the bus stop.]

When I get on the bus, I meet my friend and it’s crazy, because we keep randomly meeting each other and when we got off, we kinda sat at this bench and had the most amazing conversation. Then it struck me. This guy is my equal. We’re both on the same wavelength, so-to-speak, which is rare for me. It felt as profound as one of my many acid trips I’ve had in my day and I think that’s saying a lot. 

Part of it is the fact that we both have a firm grasp on delusion, yet are each other’s opposites in terms of conceptual mastery. I represented self-awareness; control over thy emotions through inner consciousness. He represented controlled chaos and the use of imagination aka delusion to drive force.

[What a complete crockery of glorified bullshit. The ego is feeling good tonight.]

Okay, so we’re not gods and we’re certainly not infallible to the bullshit in our minds, however knowledge and understanding is the next closest thing to enlightenment. 

It amazes me how he has such an immaculate control over the delusion he employs and way he unleashes the power of the imagination to create a self-sustaining mantra of thought and excess. Most people would be depressed, feel inadequate or suicidal, yet he makes it work - somehow. He’s the exception to the rule and it’s not because he’s lucky: It’s all just calculated in his head. He’s a high functioning maniac, so-to-speak, which is truly remarkable. He’s the disorder without the effect; the yin to my yang. 

Another part of our chemistry is the fact that we’re both free thinkers, something most people cannot comprehend. No cynicism. No rejection. No objection. These traits are limiting beliefs which aim to obstruct the flow of information because of the bias in our morality. It was a complete level of acceptance I haven’t felt in anyone else before. Yet at the same time, there was little contradiction between us and I think that’s a powerful thing to observe, especially coming from such contrasting points of view. It’s as if to say that truth is universal and uniform in it’s presence. We’re not constrained by ideology or make-believe, for everything is truly make-believe; just pure thought emanating from our core, which for any intellectual, is an exciting prospect to ponder.

Certainly raw by any measure. 

We talked for a good few hours and I’m kinda like, well fuck, I’m going to be in big trouble when I get home and I hadn’t even bought the items at this point. Totally worth it though. So I head on back home and as I open the gate to the backyard, the whole thing had already been setup and was underway. There was this great big fire, this totem thing and people were wearing special clothes n’ shit and mum gives me this look of pure contempt as I walk in. 

She’s gonna kick my head in, which I’m really not looking forward to. Especially since she’s Buddhist, because you wouldn’t need an ideological deterrent if you weren’t completely fucked to begin with.

Dynamics, dynamics, dynamics.
