I feel incredibly conflicted. 

I’m not happy with who I am and I have no idea if this is a deep seated insecurity or a legitimate concern. I feel very lonely and depressed. I feel like everything I do is just a compromise to this notion. 

Fighting my insecurity never seems to work. I mean, it has for months at a time, but in the end I always seem to fall apart. I try so hard. I put my body and my soul into making it work, yet thus far, it never has.

Perhaps it’s my standards? I mean, I got results, good results, but it always ended up being some sort of big compromise to the overall picture of what I wanted. Either it never lasted very long or the circumstances were crippled. Maybe this is a progression of sorts? Maybe in each time I try, I get closer and closer to my ideal state of being? On the other hand, maybe I should just let go of my dreams? Is it because I haven’t let go long enough?

What the fuck is healing anyway? Is the whole point that I stay single for the rest of my life and be miserable every single day until an “epiphany” occurs? I feel terrible. I can barely think. Everything is incredibly sad and I hate it so much. It’s unbearable and I have no idea what to do. But then, is letting go the equivalent of giving up? Is giving up healthy? 

I mean, how hard can it be to find a girlfriend? Just about all my friends are in stable relationships and here I am, pretending that I want to exist, because I have no other choice. I have to fight. 

Sure. I’m not entitled to a girlfriend and yes, no one’s entitled to anything. By the same token, I don’t feel entitled to my depression, yet here I am, wallowing away like a dead child. 

It’s impossible to find a relationship. Like, you’ll be dating and getting along really well with a girl, hell, even to the point of sex, only to hear that they were never interested in a relationship to begin with. They’re more than happy to be friends, but either they (or I) choose to cut it off, because of my own insecurities. Even if we know it’s not going to work out in a “relationship”, I become so desperate that I’m willing to con myself into believing anything.

There’s probably nothing more crushing than telling a girl that it’s both in your best interests to stop talking, even though you’re really good friends and get along. What the fuck. 

I feel hopeless. I’ve gone through these cycles so many times, that I just wish… I just wish that one of these days, everything works out for once and I won’t have to stop crying over my own inability to exist in harmony with feeble mind.

I’m deeply fragile. I’ve gone through enough heart break to sink the Titanic with. It’s hard. It’s fucking hard. 

All I want is for things to work out. Just once. I’ve done nothing wrong. I’m a good guy. People tell me I’m a good guy, but I’ve just been really unfortunate. I feel like the unluckiest man going round. 

I can’t tell you how happy I feel when things go my way. It feels like a miracle. I guess that’s why I’m so happy when I’m in a relationship; it feels like I’ve made it for once. I did it. I won. For just that one moment in your life, you don’t have to feel hated for who you are and my god, when you’re so deprived of your own happiness, yet so desperate to feel… euphoria beyond words.
