I wouldn’t quite say that I feel like I’m over her. Actually, I kind of do, but obviously only time will tell. I’ll be back on the emotional bandwagon in no time.

I don’t blame her. I really don’t. I think I came across as incredibly strong on this blog and if she does in fact have attachment issues, then it would have REALLY freaked her out.

Though at the same time, I do this blog for the entertainment value. I do it for the audience. It’s supposed to be raw and vicious.

I really would just like to talk to her. Even as friends.

I don’t know why she has to cut me off completely.

Is she that afraid?

Oh well.
