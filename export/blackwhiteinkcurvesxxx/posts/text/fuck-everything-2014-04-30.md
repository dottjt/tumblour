I don’t know which section of the roller-coaster this is, but it’s fucking horrible.

I begin with an intense anger and frustration; towards myself, others, my life. Some of the nasty things I feel like saying are beyond these very words. Putrid. Vile. Existinct. I feel like burning the world down and destroying everything.

Fuck my ex for leaving me, especially for another guy. That’s just bullshit. That’s so fucking bullshit and also now I realise what made my first break up so terrible; she was vulnerable and I couldn’t even be there to hug her and tell her everything was okay. I had no choice. Girls. Fuck girls. Girls are fucking retarded, insecure pieces of shit who can barely hide from their own fears and worries. You’re either talking to a brick wall because she’s so frightened of her own emotions or she’s the equivalent of a three brain cell tripod machine or she’s so emotionally crippled that she immediately runs like the fucking wind at any sight of breeze. Of course, all the normal girls with their “amazing boyfriends” can go fuck themselves. I basically break down at the sight of a cute couple and I can barely stand to look at myself. 

I don’t care how irrational am. Fuck you. It makes no fucking difference at this point. I already have ten dicks up my ass, so I probably wouldn’t mind a few more you retard. I’m sure it’s just going to feel soothing at this point. I have no empathy. No sympathy. Everyone can just die. I’ve had it. 

Of course, the immediate response to an intense emotional outburst is a sudden realisation of hopelessness, which results into an immediate break down of uncontrollable crying as the world around me comes crashing down into oblivion. I just sob until the sobbing sobs no more. I’m a wreck. 

Rinse and repeat. Anger sadness. I feel like a fucking pinball machine.

I feel like I’m being fucked from every single direction and at this point and I’ve just given up. Why bother I say. Why bother. No one cares about me and least of all, I don’t care about myself.

Yet even though I feel like I’m down there in the gutter, reaching for the bacteria; I have hope. I don’t feel it at all and fuck everyone for existing, but it’s a sixth sense somewhere in my mind.

I’m a fighter, as weak as I am. When you’ve been battered this much, sometimes you just need a break.

I’ll get past the cynicism and I’ll try again. Maybe not today. Maybe not in a week or a month. But one day, I will rise again.

I’m sick of people keep giving me the easy way out. How I shouldn’t worry or that I should just preoccupy myself with own hobbies or develop an emotional attachment to a TV character or whatever crap. That’s not what love’s about. Love is the hardest fucking thing you will try to find, but I’m willing to suffer for the pay-off.

Lucky me dickhead, because the suffering is already here and I have nothing to show for it.

ugh.
