I am the pain child. Give me your pain.

Your own life controls you. Dead-casket-walking-mess.

How do you prove your own insanity when the demons refuse to come?

Stop living. Stop being happy. Stop destroying your mind with such horrid affection!

I am not your friend. So please, fuck off.

The virility of these statements are outrageous and concern. Cease and desist, the corpse is yours.

I like to write pretty things. Iâ€™m a cute puppy :3

Boring conversation is seriously thr biggest turn off.

Someone should tit-fuck me.

The end.
