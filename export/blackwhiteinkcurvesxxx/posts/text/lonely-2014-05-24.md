For whatever reason, you feel that tiny bit more lonely, as the humanity suffocates you from within like a brutal fire in it’s incompetence.

Over time as the grass grows unconstrained, drawing life from you organs and more, the feint exterior of your soul begins to dry weary and dilapidated like flaking paint in the sun; dripping delirious onto the sidewalk of your premonition.

It’s difficult to have hope when you’re surrounded by competing recognition. It’s the variety which makes us weak; the patter which dies; lives and cries.

I want to smile. I know it’s a choice of mine, however the emotions flowing through my skull have no idea what they’re doing. The jaw alleviates itself. 

Crunch. Crutter. 

Please don’t look at me.
