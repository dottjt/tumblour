Often friends will come up to you and ask you why you’re sad. Without reason or empathy, they try their best to cheer you up. They drill you with positive reinforcement. They tell you how wonderful you are. They paint your life with a beautiful stroke. Yet the next day, you find yourself caught deep in a rut of anger and despair. You are hopeless yet again.

That’s why I believe in principle. I think it’s so incredibly important to securing your own happiness, at least talking from my own personal experience.

Feelings don’t have to be temporary, however they most likely will be if they’re based upon thoughtless attitudes. You need to create reason in your life, not a bunch of funny words in your brain.

Principle is a commitment. You are committing to what you believe, because the chaos you pertain is a bastardly flavour of scum.

Gee, you know, you can just about sell yourself as much hope as you want. We all do to some degree, depending on our level of desperation. Though put it this way: to have hope is to have hopelessness. As long as you remain critical and in judgement, your chaos will seek to realise both potentials. Freedom is not a morality. It is not a pain.

It is a lack of words.

My personal principle is that of unlimited opportunity and potential, which really is to say, an unlimited choice as to how/what I choose to experience in this life. The universe is a great big place for us to fathom. I acknowledge that the responsibility of my negativity is borne out of not taking advantage of it; I shall be grateful for my fruits.

I’m not always clear in my intention, however this is the mantra I try to apply to my life. I try my best to see the unlimited and unrealised potential in everything; the idea that there’s so much beauty in this world to discover and participate.

I choose not to live in fear, however I still do sometimes get scared. I’m not perfect, though that doesn’t mean I cannot be functional to the highest of my ability. 

I try. I really do try.
