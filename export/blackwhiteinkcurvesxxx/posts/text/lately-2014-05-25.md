I’ve been feeling relatively depressed lately. I woke up at an odd hour today and I’m feeling rather phased from my perpetual linger. I didn’t have any intentions of facing the world this morning; I simply wanted to die within the own comfort of my bed.

It’s not easy trying to find a girlfriend.

I mean, there’s nothing wrong with me. I’m incredibly responsive and caring. I know how to make a girl feel special. I’ve got a big heart and a lot of love to give. 

I just don’t have the privilege. 

I attended single sex schools my entire high school career. None of my friends knew any girls. I wasn’t part of any “sub-culture” so there was no excuse to mingle. Most people have their little group of friends leaving high school. 

I didn’t. 

I literally had to start from scratch, coming into my 20’s.

I’ve been in two different relationships over the past year, so that’s a pretty fucking good effort. I didn’t even know any girls prior to that. 

I spent most of today reading this manual on seduction and wow, it’s amazing. It just explains the different ways to attract different types of girls and it makes SO MUCH SENSE to me now. 

I can totally see where I went wrong with all those girls and what I have to do to rectify it. Thank god this tumblr is anonymous. 

Round 2, here thy come ;)
