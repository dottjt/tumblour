I had a girlfriend who loved me.

She did. I promise she did. I remember it vividly. It says so right here; etched five layers deep into the very fabric of heart. She even told me that she loved me, straight to my face, WHILE we were having sex and I’m really not trying to fuck with you now. I promise she did; I really do promise. I can feel it. I AM her love, emanating into a silly pile of squat and squalor.

Her love makes me feel human to an extent; even more so than my own consciousness. Yo and these wavy arms of mine, that share the love from within my soul; they are her love. Look at them wave baby! I remember touching her with these wavy arms and it was the greatest feeling I ever conceived from this lonely fucking body of mine. At one point in my endeavour, I may of even heard that little fucking mouth of hers, tell me to great exaggeration, how cute and special I was. All as I gave myself up to the goddess of my imagination.

It’s all I could afford to believe.

Clearly I’m a terrible liar.
