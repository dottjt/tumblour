I don’t believe in fighting. I think fighting produces more instability, not less. 

I believe in forgiveness and acceptance. Let’s start with myself. 

I forgive myself for being depressed and I accept the fact that I’m depressed. I forgive myself for all the pain I’ve gone through. I forgive myself for the way I am and I do not judge who I am and the situations I involve myself in. 

Why? 

Because to accept who you are and your circumstance, is also to accept the power you have over who you are. To accept is to give yourself responsibility and without responsibility, you cannot expect to help yourself. 

I accept the fact that I can change who I am and that I have complete control over my actions. I accept that I’m depressed because I have not yet changed my false point of view. There’s nothing wrong with being sad, because sadness is just a product. It is not an outcome. It is a simple product of my own inability to love and that’s okay. 

There’s nothing wrong with being depressed. It is neither right nor wrong and I do not blame myself or anyone else for it. I accept myself for the way I am. 

I feel much better already. In fact, I no longer feel depressed. Just really calm and peaceful. 

No blame. No self-rejection. I mean, what do those things actually achieve aside from more negativity? People think acceptance means to be content with yourself. I disagree. I think acceptance is actually about change. Unless if you accept yourself, you cannot expect to change yourself, because you are not keenly observing yourself and what you’re doing with your actions to produce your own emotion state. 

It doesn’t matter what you’re going through. Forgiveness will set you free and it’s completely pain and negative free.
