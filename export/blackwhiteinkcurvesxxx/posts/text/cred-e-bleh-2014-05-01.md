Incredible. I feel truly incredible.

I have this passion for life that I cannot quite describe. I’m happy and sympathetic towards myself. Clarity which wasn’t before prevalent.

This self-awareness stuff is profound.

I like it how it’s a technique and a practice, not just a theory. You actively have to be self-aware and it’s something you get better at the more you practice. Negative emotional reactions and states are only available if you allow yourself to get to that point, since the virtual reality of our mind is entirely discretionary.

The most significant teaching was probably the abdication of power lesson. Basically, the external world is not responsible for our pain. We personally make an agreement to have an emotional reaction, and then we blame it on something else. The problem when we say the words “He makes me feel like shit” we automatically assume it’s them who’s the cause; yet we completely ignore the fact that we’re the one making the agreement to feel like shit.

Take the traffic for example. Often people will say “oh, this traffic is pissing me off” or “I cannot believe how slow we’re going” and we automatically assume it’s the traffic that’s causing us to feel that way. In actual fact, you’re responsible for your own interpretation on the events of the outside realm. The world isn’t responsible for your emotional state. It doesn’t have your emotions, your feelings, your body, your brain.

We make the agreement to be depressed without even knowing it. Hilariously when you tell people this fact, they think “oh wow, so the traffic has been taking our power all along?” No. The traffic never had the power to change the way you feel and you neither lost nor regained power in realising this. Of course, there’s a lot of context, but that’s the basic gist of it. Simply knowing this, instantly evaporated 95% of the negativity in my mind. There’s a further 13 episodes and it feels good to know there’s more beliefs in the mind to change and improve.

I could go on for hours, however that is the power of self-awareness. Understand how the mind works and you can flow like the wind of your conceptual desires.

I love catching myself when a negative line of thought latches on; it gives you so much more power when you’re self-aware. I’m not insecure about girls any more. In fact, I seem them more as a waste of time than something I want to truly pursue.

I’m just too different to most people. I’m happy to be an individual for as long as I die. If I don’t find a girl worthy enough for my talents, then that’s quite okay. It’s no reflection on who I am as a person, because I am who I am. It makes no difference how people mingle within my life.

Call it selfish. I call it being enlightened.
