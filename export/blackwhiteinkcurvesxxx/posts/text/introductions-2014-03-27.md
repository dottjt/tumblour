Hello,

I’m inconspicuous. Well, not really. Hell, what does that even mean? Irregardless, I do know however, silly listener, that I enjoy using these symbols to express my sentiment of no particular pertension. yo-yo. yo probably got one. irony is a broomstick, yo. 

If there’s anything you must know about me, it’s that I like to write. Oddly enough, it was a passion that died along with my depressive state of mind. However now that the void has decided to encumber my soul, it would most certainly be suitable to fuck with this devil outnumbered. 

Oh dear. 

This would be my 4th tumblr blog by any account. Let me guess, girl issues? Oh, very much. A different girl for each and every blog, though that’s just concerning the logistics. I wouldn’t be too concerned with the details. They like to bite.

If it’s one thing love has taught, it’s that I know a lot more about it than I did in the past. No longer am that insecure shenanigan, plastered helplessly against the wall like a piece of petty-putty-pity. Women no longer taunt me. Little less than a year ago, I hadn’t even lost my virginity and I was incredibly insecure about my sexuality and the rest of it. 

Now, I don’t even care if I get laid and I choose not to watch porn or masturbate by choice alone. Of course, that’s not to say a massive pair of breasts wouldn’t drive me wild: It’s simply a matter of self-control. Just how I love drugs; It should be knowledge to you that I have the bodily respect not to take them, at least until the circumstances permit.

Fuck it. I love LSD more than you can imagine. 

It’s great to be familiar with love, because I now I know exactly what I like, who’s mah potential, who can be friends, etc. etc. etc. and it makes things so much easier for the dude behind this chair. Lucky me. 

So, ugh, I suppose you could say that I’m bouncing back from my second relationship - I ain’t quite finished with this bastard yet. Oh, she’s such a wonderful girl, but it’s not quite… I don’t feel right on the inside. We haven’t quite ended it, but as of today, I told her that we needed to take some time apart. Perhaps indefinitely. Long story short, I don’t know exactly how I feel, about her, about myself, about others and that’s exactly what I hope to find out. Stay tuned amigos. 

As you may tell, I’m not feeling so great right now, even if the written word rolleth brittle from my touch. Thankfully I’m well trained in the response of dealing with depression and sadness, so I’m not exactly freaking out like a headless chickin in the wind. Delusion is just a glorified image of all the negativity you abhor… trusty eraser away!

In any case, my blog shall be the great sequester that hopes and dreams of the conceptual realms of thoughts and yonder… all in this little space of solitude… I mean, tumblrtude.

Happiness doesn’t phase, nor confuse me, so let’s play around with the emotions a little. I’m actually kinda enjoying the sadness, since I haven’t felt this in a while. I’m actually funnier when I depressed and hell, it’s not really depression if you’re enjoying it. Not to mention, my number one talent and hobby, writing, is making a vicious comeback. 

Now I must throw up.
