I’m so excited for today.

I’m on day 3 of nofap, which is extraordinary. I know it doesn’t sound like a big thing, but for me, it really is. I’m addicted to porn/orgasm, no different to people who struggle with eating healthily or drug addictions. It’s the exact same chemical pathway in the brain and arguably, pornography addiction is one of the most difficult to break.

Though in actuality, addictions aren’t truly addictive nor difficult to overcome by nature; I believe they only arise from your own inability to contain them. So if you’re really depressed and anxious, obviously you’re going to binge eat yourself to death. The hard part is changing your circumstance, because when you think about it, we’re all capable of the same greatness, yet here we lie in society as a strata of potential. 

I have my last class at uni for this semester. Oh, thank fuck. It’s that shitty seminar which the tutor ends an hour early, because even he isn’t so benign to how pointless and mundane it is. Then afterwards, I’m going to study, because I’m in the mood to get stuff done. I’m also going to read books all day, just as I did yesterday. Gonna learn more about female orgasms
