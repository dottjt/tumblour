I woke up this morning and I’ve had quite enough of the way I feel.

I know exactly why I feel the way I do. I know exactly what I need to do, but I’m afraid and that’s the hard part. 

This is going to sound absurd, but I’m scared of obtaining my own happiness, because that would require letting go of my delusion and that’s terrifying for me, but it’s something I must do for myself.

However I realise that I’m never going to change if I don’t try. I’ve done this before and I can do this again.

I find it easy to worry.

My girlfriend, the girl who I loved with all my heart, left me for another guy and that’s traumatic. The thoughts that go on through my head haunt me, every second of every day. I haven’t accepted it yet. I’m still in denial. Just last night, I wished she never met this other person. Then we could still be together and happy. The pain is too great for me to bare.

I feel like a wounded soldier on the battlefield. My arm needs to be amputated, yet I consistently come up with reasons to postpone the surgery. I keep telling myself that it’s not necessary, perhaps even denying the condition of my arm. Yet the longer it goes on, the longer the gangrene progresses and makes things worse.

I’m ready for change.

I’m scared and it hurts, but I’m no more scared or hurt than I’ll ever be and that’s an important realisation.

This is a commitment to my own happiness. I promise I’ll be happy again. Even if it means cutting off all my limbs. These are conceptual limbs in my mind. They are not real, yet they FEEL real. I can do this. I know I can.

It’s not going to happen overnight. I’m crying already and it’s going to take time. There are a few agreements I need to make to myself and I’m never going to be perfect, because the pain will always remain the same, but there’s still a lot I can do for myself.

I’ll talk about what I need to do in another post. I have work now.
