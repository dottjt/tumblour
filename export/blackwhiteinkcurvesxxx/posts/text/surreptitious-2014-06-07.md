Arrogant. Out of touch. Total bewilderment verging on anger and frustration. Triumphal, successful emperor. River of deceit. Insufferable. Conceited. Whimsical. Erudite. Invincibly benign. Scum.

I’m feeling somewhat potent and confused at this hour. I don’t really know who I am. I’m feeling incredibly vulnerable about myself, at an hour which shouts loneliness; down summers into post-fatal submission. 

I woke up inextricably today and thought, “There’s no reason for me to give up. There’s no reason why I cannot try.”

Of course, that’s a lot easier said than done. I’m incredibly fragile right now. I feel like an injured man walking a faulty tightrope. I’m going to fall off. I will. Death awaits.

So here I am. I’m standing. I’m remaining and I’m not going to give up. As hard as I fall, I’ve never ever given up on myself. It’s not easy. Hell, if it were so simple, I wouldn’t be suffering this predicament. 

I think it’s important to understand that privilege is an inherently arrogant construct. I get it. I don’t have any girls, but when you look at what I do have, it is almost conceivably rude for me to exclaim otherwise. I have a relative amount of wealth. I have a vast sense of place and being. I have intelligence. I have education. I have romantic experiences to die for. I have a mother. I have friends. I have stability. When I think about it, I have so bloody much; so much of life that I choose to ignore because I’m an ungrateful hack. 

Lastly, I really liked this quote on heart break: 

“This life is what you make it. No matter what, you’re going to mess up sometimes, it’s a universal truth. But the good part is you get to decide how you’re going to mess it up. Girls will be your friends - they’ll act like it anyway. But just remember, some come, some go. The ones that stay with you through everything - they’re your true best friends. Don’t let go of them. Also remember, sisters make the best friends in the world. As for lovers, well, they’ll come and go too. And baby, I hate to say it, most of them - actually pretty much all of them are going to break your heart, but you can’t give up because if you give up, you’ll never find your soulmate. You’ll never find that half who makes you whole and that goes for everything. Just because you fail once, doesn’t mean you’re gonna fail at everything. Keep trying, hold on, and always, always, always believe in yourself, because if you don’t, then who will, sweetie? So keep your head high, keep your chin up, and most importantly, keep smiling, because life’s a beautiful thing and there’s so much to smile about.” 
― Marilyn Monroe
