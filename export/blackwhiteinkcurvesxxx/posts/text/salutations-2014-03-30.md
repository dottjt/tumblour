hai thar.

So. Words. Great. 

Sometimes I eat them. Oh yes, you see, there are many things you can do with the conceptual disaster awaiting in limbo, ever-so diligently in that consolidation of yours. We eat our thoughts for another day, always striving for the lowest common denominator - neurological death. That’s not to say the degradation cannot prove helpful. Take this pill, my precious child. It literally speaks your name, if ever your deception rung true. 

It takes more energy to produce a thought, than to decay within the vicinity of your own recollection, though I don’t suppose your biology discards such information. It cherishes the longing, as if borne out of necessity. Oh, the farce.

I beg you. Set the fire free from it’s oxygen. These words must be yours.

I understand, the focus hurts when the beating ceases to be true, though it hurts no more than the focus itself, silly illusion.

Try and think of the beating as an added bonus. Choose wisely.
