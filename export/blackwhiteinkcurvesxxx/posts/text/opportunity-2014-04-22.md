Mellow.

As if the fissile of my conceptual firework has resulted in three kids and a dilapidating mortgage. The thought hurts more than the outcome.

After all, that’s how most romances start; as an idea. We never truly fall in-love with the actual person, but rather our ideal of them. We want to fall in-love because we’re insecure. I’m highly insecure. We all are. 

If you have a girlfriend or a boyfriend, I want you to be grateful for them. You have something most people don’t have. I want you to tell them every single day, how much they mean to your life because one day, they might not be there. You don’t realise how bad it is until they’re gone and I think most people don’t ever truly recover from their first relationship, myself included. You soldier on. 

Some people have their lives handed to them on a platter and they can’t quite see how good they have it. They breathe privilege like it’s air. They drown in their own excess without knowing it.

Not me. Hell no.

I have to fight for what I want. I didn’t grow up with emotional security. I didn’t have many friends. I didn’t have social groups to rely on. I was a lone wolf and I had to create my own reality. I didn’t have my emotions hand-packaged and handed to me; I had to seek them with my own claws. The same goes for women. I knew no girls leaving high school. Zero. Not even friends who knew girls. I would have passed out in their presence anyway. Vagina’s were pixels on a computer screen and nothing more. 

Now I know many.

Everyone is insecure about different things. For some people it’s their image. Their weight. What people think of them. Physical appearance. Sexuality. Age. Worthiness. Wealth. Career. Intelligence. Rejection.

Just about anything our brains will latch onto.

For me it’s love. I’m so insecure about being in love, that I’m willing to go to great extremes just to find it.

I’m not a bad person. I’ve never cheated on a girlfriend. I always do my best to make them feel special. They all tell me how amazing I am. In fact, none of my relationships should have ever ended, but I had no control over their circumstances. One girl turned out to be a complete asshole who turned me off women for years. The first girl had extreme depression. Another girl just disappeared out of the blue. The last one left me for another guy.

All I want is the chance.

Just one opportunity to actually prove myself.

I should have given up a long time ago. I should have just packed up my bags and neglected the idea that I was someone who could be loved. But I haven’t. I’ve fought for what I think I deserve and no matter how many times I’m shoved into the ground, beaten and crushed, I’m going to continue to fight until I feel the emotions I deserve, flowing through my blood and into my heart. Every. Single. Day. 

So fuck, the next time you see that special person, please tell them how much they mean to you because I’m crying right now and that’s really not fair.
