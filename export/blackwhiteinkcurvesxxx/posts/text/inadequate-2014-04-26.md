The world isn’t exactly on my side, but that’s okay. I think I may have come full circle in my mind. Let’s find out.

Last night was particularly horrible for me. I had a crushing sense of inadequacy. Strong feelings of insecurity towards my life. All to do with love/relationships.

You feel so helpless because you realise that love isn’t something you can force. It isn’t something that rocks up at your doorstep. It very much feels like a lottery to me. That’s why I find it so addictive.

Of course, when you think about it, you set the terms for what love is. Which is really to say, why can I not love myself? Your desperation and limited focus won’t allow it. Room for change, right there.

I don’t blame myself. I’ve been constantly battered with heart break. It’s completely and utterly fucked. I’m not sure what would constitute “a normal amount of emotional pain”, but I feel like a rag doll with no legs at this point. I’ve had my emotions and feelings flung around so violently that it’s torn me apart and shredded me down to the simple human that my pain is capable of. I’ll sit at my desk and stare blankly into the screen, desperate for even a former hint of my humanity to make it’s stunted comeback.

I mean, you wonder why these words have crass.

Writing doesn’t become this fluent unless it weren’t so ridiculously compelled to feel normal. I am a cat. This is a coping mechanism, not an art. 

Though I do love it when the grammar rolls effortless into the culinary pie of my peachy disaster.

I think there’s no reason to beat myself down. I felt defeated last night, but a follower sent me this quote and it sort of gave me a glimpse of perspective:

“Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time.” - Thomas A. Edison

Also that I don’t need to rely on someone else to be happy with who I am. The problem is that you hone your insecurity for such a long time, that you set yourself up for failure.

It sucks when you’re stuck within the realm of fear during an “episode”, because in order to get out you need to take a step back from where you are and observe your mania, which is difficult. Thankfully this morning, I realised I have a whole bunch of techniques I can use to help change the way I feel.

Thank god. I should be fine by lunchtime.
