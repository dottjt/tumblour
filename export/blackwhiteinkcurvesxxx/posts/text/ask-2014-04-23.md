“Right. I’m gunna be totally honest right now. 

If you have the “love of your life” on tumblr, you’re not doing yourself any favors with these posts.

I’m not saying that you shouldn’t be expressing yourself, and that your feelings are wrong. I endorse it. 

BUT. As a stranger, I feel completely and utterly overwhelmed. One minute you’re beside yourself, the next you talk about death and then you’re at peace with your life? 

If the poor girl has attachment issues, and now you’ve placed an ENORMOUS amount of pressure on her she’ll be literally freaking the fuck out. If I were her, I would consider getting back with you only out of guilt. Is that something you would want? 

However, if she ISN’T reading your posts then, I’m sorry you’re on this emotional roller coaster, and I hope things work out.”
