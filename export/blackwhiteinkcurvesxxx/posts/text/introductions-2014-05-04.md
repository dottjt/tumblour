“Hello sweet stranger; dabbled silly in the spine of a cute exterior. I apologise. I’m obsessed with words.”

Some people freak da fuck out.

Others post it on their wall as a sign of simplicity.

Some reply with a simple ‘hi’.

Others like the words and follow the blog.

Some never reply.

Others feel compelled to comment on the ability of my writing.

Some thank me.

Others laugh at the senselessness of the words.

Some feel special.

Others display a deep concern for my nature.

Some are downright confused and disturbed.

Others feel completely cheated at the idea of it’s mass produced projection. Even though 'hi’ is the most generic and bland introduction to date.

Yet.

Perhaps only one has questioned the content of my rhetoric.

That’s what I’m looking for.

Thank you.
