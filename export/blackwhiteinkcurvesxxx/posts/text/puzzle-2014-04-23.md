The missing puzzle piece. 

So I was reading back through our last conversation and this caught my eye.

“Let’s put it this way, for the last 2 years any time a guy has asked me out I’ve only flat out said no.

I haven’t had any interest in relationships, I don’t like to be vulnerable and I don’t like the trouble of either hiding it from my family or having to explain it to them.

But I think I’m willing to go through with that trouble…”

So there you have it folks. She freaked out. She has issues with attachment.

I guess it was too good to be true. I hope she can find it in her heart to love me. I just know we could be an amazing couple together, though that’s precisely the problem. She’s scared.

All I can do is wish her the best of luck and I shall do precisely that xx
