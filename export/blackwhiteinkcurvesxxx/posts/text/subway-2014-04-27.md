Fuck it. 

So like, I really don’t think I care about anything any more. I’m in that sort of “oh, why bother” mood, to the extent that I’m contemplating getting subway for breakfast every single day of my entire existence because I don’t want to have to worry about the nutritional necessities of my being.

Then it occurred to me, what the fuck, I can just make my own subway using my own ingredients at home. It just makes so much more sense and fuck, I’m going to make the best fucking sandwiches money can buy and not even that fucker Jesus can stop me, because I’m feeling like a complete ass hole at the moment and I really don’t think I care any more.

I’m so fucking horny that all I can think about is sex and gee, it’s not like I want to be like this, but try not orgasming for 27 days and THEN try and tell me how you feel. Not like that pretty like flower on the wall.

I’ve realised that nofap only really works well when you’re in a stable relationship and or if you’re not completely insecure about yourself, though the alternative is to feel like complete shit and remain insecure, so it’s like being stuck between a rock and what the fuck; all I can think about are boobs.

I’m a freak. Sorry. 

I don’t see what difference it makes at this point.
