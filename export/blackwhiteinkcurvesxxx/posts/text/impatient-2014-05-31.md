You know, in all this time, not once did this thought ever occur to me. The idea that…

I’ll incredibly impatient. 

What this ultimately translates to is a renewed sense of entitlement. You take life for granted. You become anxious and pitiful. 

Well, no thank you. That’s not how I want to live my life. Not any more. 

I’m not going worry about what I don’t have. I’m not going to have a false expectation of myself. Cause you know what?

One of these days, I’m going to be having so much sex with a girl I love more than anything else in the world, that there won’t be a damn thing the world can do about it. It’s going to be exactly as I imagine it to be, just as my first relationship was. 

I’m so incredibly young and I have so much to look forward to. So I’m not going to worry about my life. I’m not going to live in fear and regret. I’m going to take the opportunity to embrace it. 

Just because it ain’t Christmas everyday, doesn’t mean I can’t put a smile on my face.

And fuck. I’ve been fortunate enough to partake in several relationships with girls I’ve truly loved. That’s more than most can say and all within the past 10 months!

I’m an independent man. Bite me.
