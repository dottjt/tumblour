I feel hopeless again. 

I’ve been feeling very, “Why do I bother with everything?” lately. I feel passion at brief moments, but by the next day, the hype has died down and I feel overcome with nothingness. It doesn’t matter how far I progress, by the next day I just forget everything I’ve learnt. Gotta pick myself back up off the floor. 

Ugh. I just don’t feel ready and I’m confused and I don’t know. 

I don’t know why I bother with anything. Nothing ends up working out anyway. It all just seems like one never-ending episode of suffering. I think I’m still stuck at this, “Well, if I don’t have a girlfriend, then what’s the point?” mentality. I can’t see beyond that. 

It really is just the affection and emotional connection I crave from people. The problem is that this always leads to some sort of attachment and while that’s not a bad thing, I’m yet to find a girl who’s ready for that sort of thing. 

I feel like I’m just tinkering with hope here. I always end up questioning why I do everything and then it all falls apart in the end. I’ve been trying; I really have. However right now, I honestly just feel like crawling up into a ball and crying, but it’s 10:04 AM and I only just woke up. 

Why does everything have to be so difficult :(
