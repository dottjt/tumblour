You should meet my girlfriend. Oh yeah, didn’t you know!? I have a girlfriend now! She’s such an amazing little bunny! I love her so incredibly much!

She’s just gorgeous. She has the most bubbly personality I’ve ever come across and we take the most amazing couple selfies together! I couldn’t imagine life without her! 

We’re so madly in-love. We like to hold each other and kiss and make out and all that normal couple stuff. We just click like anything. She makes me so happy!

She’s super cute and sweet. Sometimes we just lie there and hold each other and we won’t murmur a word. We just enjoy each other’s company. 

It’s neat. 

So yeah, I’m happy. I’ve got this lovely girlfriend, who cares about me more than anything else in the world. 

PS: Someone please kill me. I’m miserable and without partner.
