I don’t feel that tumblr is the best thing for my head atm, so I’ve decided to log out for a while. 

If you’d like to contact me, feel free to say hi. I would certainly appreciate it. Conversation is probably going to help, at least while I endlessly transpire through my grief.

If not, my notepad will keep me company. Fuck.
