I feel weak when I think about her.

It’s all I could do this morning as I strolled aimlessly through the aisles at work.

I’ve barely spoken to her and I don’t even think I know her name, but I can’t stop thinking about her. She makes me feel entirely dependent and it’s terrifying, just as it is completely comforting. 

She’s like a lingering Tuesday thought on a Saturday afternoon; hooked and snapped like the fine fabric from within the bottom of my sullen toes. There really no logic to describe the way I feel; only a sudden draw that my peripheral vision cannot shake off. 

A derailing roller-coaster that I don’t intend on stopping. I want to live.

I think I’ve sold her as an idea in my mind. I think that’s how most romances begin; as an idea. 

I suppose it’s one-sided in that sense, though never have I wanted this idea more than anything else in my life. It’s reinforced delusion with a hint of bliss. I once lost it due to tragic circumstances and for the first time since then, I can feel the electricity spark conscious within my spine; the return of a neural pathway. 

I feel entirely irrational at this hour. I wonder if it’s real? Maybe I’m just really desperate and incomprehensible? Certainly tragic by any measure.

Anticipation. I want to cry.
