I feel empty beyond words.

I decided to have another cigarette, which really was the worst idea and all the while, my dog is dying to play with me. It’s jumping on me. It’s the nicest, cutest fucking dog and there I am, ignoring it and chain smoking like an idiot.

Then it occurred to me.

I’m desperate for love. I feel no love for my life.

I feel like no one loves me.

You look everywhere for it, yet it’s not there. That’s why you comfort eat. That’s why you become entirely irrational, looking for something you can’t find. Not even in my fucking dog, which loves me more than anything in the whole entire world.

That’s a very powerful realisation.
