I fear that my ex thinks I’m a bad person. I’m not sure if our relationship made her feel better or worse in the end, but I can imagine that it was probably just as traumatic for her as it was me.

Long distance just destroys everything. Even if it’s the most amazing person in the world, it really just kills it beyond no end. I mean, I couldn’t even hold her when she was in need and that still crushes me till this day. 

I don’t know if I should ever contact her again. Fuck, I’d do it in a heartbeat, but I’m… really afraid. I don’t know how’d she react or feel. I said I’d give it a year if I were to ever contact again, but even then, I just wouldn’t know what to do or what to say. Probably that I was sorry. 

I can say to a large degree of confidence that I am over her emotionally. She doesn’t enter my mind on a day to day schedule. I think I certainly would have the capacity to love her again, but I’m not sure if a) That’s a risk I want to take or b) If it’s the best thing for my health. 

But I suppose what’s replaced her, is a deep sense of insecurity in my heart. She was really fucking special to me. I cannot deny that.

Oh well. I’m sure it could be a whole lot worse.
