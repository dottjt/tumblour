The problem with being idealistic, is that it completely divides your undeniably perpetrated significance into incomprehensible shreds of irrationality, marred only by your inability to reciprocate humble nature. In a sense, I think the depression demonstrates your willingness to live. Getting through it proves that you have so much love to give.

I’m incredibly affectionate and that aspect of my personality lends disgrace to the pitiful argument of my life. I’m like, the happiest person in the world when I’m not depressed and I think most people would agree.

It’s only fair that I come out and publicly state that I’m a complete hypocrite. Delusional in almost every single aspect of my nature and a fallacy waiting to transpire.

My spelling is terrible and my face is melted. 

My arguments are largely emotional and short-sighted. I tell people to be “humble” and in “good spirit” all while I lavish myself within a fun house of sacrilegious privilege. I can’t stand people who spew privilege, yet here I stand, the very cause of this sickness that runs straight through society like a river of deceit. Let me remind you that happiness itself is a privilege. Please do not abuse it.

Yet here I lie, no longer in privilege and struggling in vain to the very tears of my own. I have murdered all your doubts, one letter at a time. 

I am your end result of abuse. Perish and wither into the clouds no more. 

I am your deliberate fool.
