burkelonsdale "A good, healthy relationship is definitely not overrated!“ 

If only life were so perfect. Some people don’t have that sort of privilege, fortunately or unfortunately. 

Have a fallen madly in-love before? Certainly.

Is it something I have control over? No. 

Has it lead to a relationship? Two, in fact. 

Is it happening now? No.

Oh well.

It doesn’t mean I can’t be happy and love myself :)
