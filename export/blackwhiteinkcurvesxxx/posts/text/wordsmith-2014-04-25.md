I can’t be trusted.

I mean, I couldn’t be a more genuine person and I’m wise as heck. All my friends are completely fucked, so I’ve seen the best and worst of delusion in it’s prime. I have the cure within my mind, because I’m living proof that you don’t have be entirely retarded to project intelligence.

Though I’m particularly dangerous when it comes to flirt and seduction.

When I’m really sold on a particular character, I know exactly what to tell a person to get them to fall in-love with me and I know the precise words they want, no, NEED to hear. Which words will have what effect. The drama of the chase. It’s like a precise grammatical clockwork I adhere to.

The dangerous thing is that it’s all improvised and instantaneous. I never hesitate when I’m in the process of securing a girl, because I know that no matter how many odd balls they throw at me, I can easy talk my way into convincing them otherwise. So you’re insecure about a, b and c? Well, it’s quite possible that my presence will completely aid those insecurities, as well heighten your sense of self-worth because of x, y and z.

I work in a hardware store and gee, there’s always some fucktard in need of some advice on blinds and fuck, I know nothing about hardware things at all and god, no one actually knows anything about blinds, but I always heroically volunteer to help customers with blind queries, because I know I can just about bullshit my way through anything. 

Is it true? Oh, absolutely. However I keep all my promises. I may be the social manipulator, however that’s an aspect which requires talent and dedication. You never start fights with battles you cannot win.

My aim is to create experiences for people to remember for the rest of their lives. It’s what I love doing as a human being.

Now the question I often ask myself, is whether these words are driven by my temporary feelings (lust) or if they’re genuine from my heart. As I’ve learnt earlier from my previous dabble into love, romance is just an idea you keep in your mind and you can just about convince anyone that love is a real thing. Perhaps it depends on how well one can convince myself the idea and further maintain it.

I mean, obviously you know you’re going to get along better with some people than others, however sometimes you just want to have some fun.

I know it sounds rather terrifying, but it’s really just calculated brilliance. I like to make girls feel special. I’m the kind of guy who’ll hand write you poetry everyday. I’ll cuddle you and touch you right. I know exactly how to use these hands to evoke excitement and pleasure. I just geddit. 

Now is that fair to be considered a bad thing at all?

Well, it depends on whether you like to cherish the ignorance or not. People really aren’t as stupid as you think they are and I’m just being plain honest here. I mean, would you rather a guy flat-out lie to you for sex or would you rather share something a little deeper where in fact, you get to have a say into the whole process and tailor your experience to the mind you see fit?

I like to be open and honest and that extends to admitting the rather extraordinary capabilities of the human mind. I would never in my life cheat on a girl. I’ve always been respectful and hell, I’ve even let a prior girlfriend be with another guy because that was what made her happier. I’m not a bad person and I have an awful amount of integrity to uphold.

I just, uh, like to pull strings. Cause I’m just a cutie boy :3

cutie, cutie ^_^
