Fear is the premise of my woes.

I fear that I may not be in a fantastic relationship with a girl I love more than life itself. That is the root of my insecurity. 

I worry that I may never love again. Of course, none of it is real. Though naturally I’m rather traumatised so I thought it might be helpful to compile a history of women/relationships in my life:

- Fat, unpopular, ethnic kid growing up in rural primary school. Immensely disliked by women.

- Mother’s failed marriage and her own attitudes towards love; one-sided dictatorship on mother’s behalf.

- Multiple father figures. No contact with biological father since age 10.

- Zero social skills leading into high school. Low self-esteem. Scared of girls.

- Intense crushes on various girls throughout high school. Non-existent face-to-face contact with women. Obsession beyond belief.

- General cynicism towards love and women leaving high school. Tarnished by multiple encounters. Convinced love isn’t real. Defeated. Apathetic towards women.

- Mid 2013. Desperate to lose virginity. Makes first tumblr account.

- First relationship. Completely changes life. Obsessed with love. Complete euphoria.

- First break up. Completely debilitating. Severe depression for months. First suicidal thought. Recovery to large extent, but resulting compromise: Intense desperation/insecurity for love, due to first relationship’s short-lived nature.

- Bad encounter with girl. Falsely mislead. Disappears completely.

- Second relationship. “Compromise” relationship. Less intense than first. Resulting failure. Leaves for other guy. 

- Second break up. Not as bad as first. More resilient, though still desperate.

- Discovers girl comparable to first. Disappears.

In general, I’ve had vastly more negative experiences than positive, though that isn’t to say that it haven’t shaped me into a more positive person. I now have an extremely high level of confidence and enough social skills to approach just about anyone.

Fuck. I’ve done pretty well for myself. I should be completely fucked up, but I’m actually doing quite well. In fact, I’m hardly doing bad at all. I eat healthily, exercise and workout regularly, only dabble in temporary depression, have great friends, a stable income, am vastly optimistic with a great passion for learning, I don’t blah, blah, blah.

I feel calm.
