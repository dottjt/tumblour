Sex is weird. 

It’s great for about 5 seconds, until you realise that you’re actually penetrating another person.

Then it becomes absolutely terrifying.

Why can’t I get this condom on? Do we really need to use a condom? Why can’t I just wipe it on your face? What do you mean you don’t have a face!? 

Oh right. I’m talking to the driveway again. 

Though, for lack of better words, I shall be quite sincere with the apology I spew j'chaotic:

“Today is a Thursday.

Tomorrow is a Friday.

But Saturday. My Dear Saturday.

You are no Sunday.”

Go forth and eat rabies.
