I must say, I have a new-found appreciation for women who reject/ignore guys and in retrospect, I couldn’t be more grateful for all the people who’ve turned me down.

With that said, women who unnecessarily tease men or treat them like shit, just because it boosts their insignificant sense of self-worth, can get fucked.

Please do understand that in most cases, you’re dealing with very vulnerable and desperate men, who are mentally ill and as a result, deserve respect and consideration. I am mentally ill and I am culprit.

Deary me. 

The idea of falling in-love freaks me out now. I never thought I’d say it, not in a million years. You know what though, it’s given me a greater appreciation for what a relationship is and how best to personally go about it. 

I know one day I’ll fall in-love again, so being bother me being single and when it does happen, I know it’s going to be with someone really, super special. 

That’s okay though. It just gives me more space to myself
