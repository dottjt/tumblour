Depression is horrible. It’s so fucking horrible.

When you have so much life to give, yet so little expression to gain, your pain trickles hopeless down the senses you abhor, into a fatal pit of detriment and ghast. Comprehension is a madness which teeters delinquent within your mind. You feel so incredibly dead on the inside. Arguably, you may as well be. 

That gaping hole which excretes your loneliness so far and so wide, that you’re too afraid to catch the falling dagger as it shatters relentless on your already broken hand. Bite me till I drop. 

When in the face of calamity; when even hope itself becomes nothing more than a barbaric relic for generations to squander, will only your imagination combust into a thousand useless tiles, all as illusory as the next. When you lie in bed to cry and wither… there is no redemption for the poor soul who endures such farce. 

It’s the most debilitating, deep feeling I’ve ever felt inside my heart. It broods cancer, just as it promotes lust. I can’t take this any more. I can’t deal with reality. I want to collapse, NOT remain on the edge any longer.
