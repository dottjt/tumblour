You can discover a lot about someone, simply by the way they look. I’m a big proponent of the theory that people are a product of their environment and that stereotypes exist, if only to varying degrees.

In a sense, I’m very much a stereotype, at least to the extent that I’ve never met anyone like me. That’s why I play the journalist role in most groups - I simply don’t fit in. I merely observe and walk away. I’ve met very few, if any, journalist roles in my life. Most people adhere to some sort of structure and at the end of the day, I’m just dying to hear what people have to say. Hence journalist. 

Of course, not to be confused with the profession. This is a social role at it’s core, though they have many similarities.

The journalist is a vary versatile role. Generally I’m quite likeable because I’m incredibly nice, but I also provide insight. I question, but not to the point of irritation. Once people realise it’s a genuine concern, they begin to give into the words. It’s a very powerful effect that’s not to be taken lightly.

I used to be good friends with the LADS, the drug addicts, the drug dealers, the indie crowd, the anarchists, the disillusioned (a lot of these groups interchange). Hell, I was even part of a group of 16 year olds when I was 20. My best friend was 12 when I was 19. Of course, these interactions don’t last forever, once you realise how out of place ye ol’ journaliste is.

I always want to get into new groups of people. I want to learn. I want to experience. One thing that really helps with gaining acceptance, is playing ignorant. You make yourself seem vulnerable, so people don’t feel so threatened by you. I’d love to be part of something grunge thing, though a lot of groups rely on style and that’s something I’m yet to adapt.

I mostly use my words. I’m an arbiter of wit. I can get most people to like me. How you do it, is that you make fun of them to the extent that they’re comfortable, yet not vulnerable. It displays confidence, though there have been many a time when I should have had my head punched in, but I kept my cool and I came out on top. Admittedly, some confrontations should be avoided and I get cocky, but at least I have my insane stories to tell. It’s hilarious, because I don’t dress the part, so I look awfully out of place, but that’s part of the charm. It’s a sort of self-acceptance, shrouded in pride.

So yes, I love to play characters. I study seduction, social proofing, propaganda etc. Self-awareness is a very powerful tool as well. Once you instantly spot delusion, you can use it to your advantage and “play the part”.

Excellent.
