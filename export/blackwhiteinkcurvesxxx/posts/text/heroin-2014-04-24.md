I love heroin.

It’s probably my favourite drug of all time.

I love that feeling after a hard day’s work, when you crack out the kit and inject yourself with pure inanimate pleasure.

Usually the first hit is most anticipated. I like to double dose after lunch, because fucking hell, my skin is rotting and I gotta do something to take my mind off the kill. I’m generally shaking by dinner.

It’s my first proper meal of the day.

It used to be funny this and funny that. Now everything fucking sucks, though I suppose it’s an itch you just gotta keep going. I’m a vacuum of pain and I can’t quite remember the words which suggested I stop and get a real occupation. The occupation of my mind.

Fuck the itch. 

The itch loves you. It caresses you till you cry and then takes your wallet and more. It scratches your eyes out until it see what you don’t want to. Always always, never never. It bores into your soul and bleeds you dry of your sheen. It burns into your skin; scaring the fabric of your desire. It trickles down your sully tears, swearing hapless against the will of your throne. 

Never saying goodbye.

Grab your guns folks. The bitch ain’t coming back.
