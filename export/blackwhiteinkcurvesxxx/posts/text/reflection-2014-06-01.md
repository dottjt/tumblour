Today’s been quite a pleasure. I’m slowly becoming the person I want to express. I’m dissolving my dependence on the silly things life, while regaining my hidden independence which once roamed free within my mind. 

Independence to a large extent is about being in control of who you are. It’s about harnessing the cause/effect relationship of your own destiny. It’s about not take your own reality personally on any level. You are neither defined by your failures, nor your successes. You are simply human and that can entail whatever your journey provides. 

If I can’t get a girlfriend, that’s no reflection on my character as a human being. If I can’t afford a house, that’s no reflection on my wealth. It’s about having an open and honest perspective on things and realising that while you may not earn your first million within the first six months of your working career, doesn’t mean that you’re worthless and shrill. There never should be a reason to break down and give up on your own potential, in the face of human nature.

It’s a very active process for me. It’s about making small, accumulative changes; such as choosing to study or work out. It’s about adopting a certain frame of mind. In everything you do, you the battle status quo with a boundless sense of opportunity and fervor. 

I like it for the challenge. However I love it even more for the change. I’m incredibly prone to change, which on the flip-side, also extends to an instability of my nature.

Who’s to say that I won’t crumble back to my old ways so easily? Well, since leaving high school, I’ve made A LOT of changes to my character and lifestyle. I’m now completely unrecognisable to the person I was one year ago, let alone three. I feel like I’m constantly inching towards my goals, because my heart is in the right place, even if it sometimes fluctuates wild.

It’s one thing to identity delusion, but to change it takes real courage and that’s a notion I’ve always adopted. 

I’ve come to terms that sex won’t make me happy. You can consume as much “sex” as you want, but as long as you have that rearing insecurity eating away at your soul, there will never be enough cleavage to keep your attention satisfied. So please, I don’t want to see your boobs. They don’t mean anything to me, unless if I love you and chances are, I won’t be loving you for your boobs. 

…because remember folks, it’s always the affection which will keep you coming back for more; something which you cannot obtain from an image. A pixel can’t hug you, no more than your own desperation would provide. Blowing your load to a computer screen won’t make you feel any more loved, no more than pretending the dopamine rush was worth effort.

Well, there you have it. Enjoy your Sunday night. 

PS: This is the most pretentious piece of crap I’ve ever written, but I loooooooove it.
