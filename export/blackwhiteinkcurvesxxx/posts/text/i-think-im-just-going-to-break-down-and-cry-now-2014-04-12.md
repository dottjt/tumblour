I think I’m just going to break down and cry now.

I don’t really feel I have another option at this stage.

I just want to disappear. I don’t see the point to any of this. All I feel is the sadness and it’s the most terrible thing I’ve ever felt in my entire life. I wish it would go away. I really do :(
