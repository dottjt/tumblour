No amount of Dopamine is going to make me happy.

I did that thing where you masturbate three times in a row and you know it successively feels worse and more painful each time you do it, yet it doesn’t quite register in your mind. You’re in such a state of disillusion and wander, that you’re willing to do anything to keep the faltering party alive.

People eat hope like it’s fucking confetti. 

Confetti whore.
