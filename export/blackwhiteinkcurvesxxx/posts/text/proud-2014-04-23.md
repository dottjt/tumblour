Hi,

Here you are. Sitting at your desk again. You’ve done very well for yourself and more importantly, you should be proud of who you are.

When you get caught up in the calamities of life, you forget the extent to which you struggle. I’ve struggled dearly. I went through hundreds of women to fulfil my own insecurity. While love is important, obsession isn’t. On the one hand, being in a relationship is the most fantastic thing I’ve ever experienced. Though couldn’t you say the exact same thing about orgasm? Isn’t orgasm this magical experience?

It’s all about how you sell the idea to yourself. You get so caught up on this idea of romance, that it completely blinds your ability to see the beauty in anything else. Your mind is diseased. The problem with immediately giving up orgasm, is that your automatic response is to expend your sexual energy on trying to find a girl to fuck in real life, instead of masturbating to one on a computer screen. This is ultimately self-defeating.

I know you have a big heart in there some where. We just need to find a space to fit you in.

Sincerely,

me.
