Oh noe!

So she didn’t respond to my kik message last night and I guess I was a little gutted (except for the fact that I got to experience a full night’s sleep), but it was Easter Monday and she’s kinda religious, so maybe that’s what it was. I don’t think it’s that she doesn’t care about me, judging by what she posted on her tumblr, but I really can’t stop thinking about her.

Obviously the next best alternative for me was to re-read our last conversation and it was so ridiculously adorable! We were both incredibly nervous and the one thing that I truly appreciated, was the high level of respect and understanding we had for each other. Not a sort of compromise, but a genuine concern that emanated for our hearts. I just love everything about her.

I can’t say I’m particularly religious myself, but she’s probably the first person where I’ve actually taken an appreciation to their faith. She seems to have a very different view on religion than most people. She also doesn’t seem that uptight about who she is and that’s quite the godsend, even though the founding principles are still there. I can’t take anything particularly seriously and I’m pretty sure my main talent is to make fun of people in the most inappropriate way possible. So if she can tolerate being called a skanky hoe (and it’s millions of different variations) fifty times a day and get a kick out of it, then we’re looking at a real winner.

Of course, I also love to be cute and affectionate. It helps to switch between the two. Oh god, I love doing that.

“Gee baby, where’s your whore make up, because you’re just not as pretty as all the other non-whorish girls… awwwww baby! You’re so cute, I love you so much! :3” *cuddles*

I just really like her personality. It’s familiar, though different. Since we can’t have sex, it just gives room to explore so many other things! Generally the first thing you do in a relationship is fuck heaps, because we’re dying for that temporary feeling of euphoria. It controls you. Yet there’s nothing that special about it. Sex doesn’t create vivid memories, like going on a cute date does. They’re not the moments you’re going to remembering in ten years time.

I’m dying to take cute selfies together (OMG did anyone say tumblr gifs!?!?!) and to hold her in my lap and gee, we’ve only had one real time conversation, I don’t know what her voice sounds like and I’m already ten steps ahead and on the boat towards America. I’m just have patience because I think I already know how it’s all going to play out, at least with my head. She’s such a cutie girl :3

I honestly cannot wait.
