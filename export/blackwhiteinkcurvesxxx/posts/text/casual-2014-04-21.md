I’ve never had casual sex and I don’t think I’ve ever going to have casual sex, ever. I’ve only ever made love to people I care about and *ahem* loved. 

I mean, I’d LOVE to have casual sex. I just don’t know anyone of that nature. 

From what I’ve been told, most people don’t enjoy it and it turns into an unequal attachment at some point, though it’s something I cannot relate to and that’s precisely the problem. I just want to experience it, if only once. I’ve never really used a person for their vagina, at least to the extent of pure orgasm and nothing more. I mean, the idea has certainly floated around, but it’s never actually happened.

Fuck.

Fuck me.

Fuck me for the regret.

Make me feel used. Never talk to me again. Spit in my face and rub my cock with your high heels…

Ah gee, I made it ridiculously weird now. I’m sorry lonely world, you beautiful thing.

*places gun in mouth*

*deep throats gun*

As you can tell, I can’t take anything seriously at this hour. I think I’m just happy :D

Though really, from what I can tell, casual sex is a terrible idea, because either it’s with someone you completely despise or a girl who’s a friend and should stay a friend, not a lover. Hmmmm, then what about multiple lovers?

I guess I’d need multiple dicks.
