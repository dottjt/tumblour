Hi.

You may know me as that creep on the sidewalk. I would like to think I garner your support, I hope.

Pity. I want each and everyone of you to shower me with pity and sympathy and guilt and pride and shame. I am an animal unworthy of your sins.

You’re retarded Larry. Deal with it. 

I was looking at another person’s tumblr earlier and I couldn’t help but notice all the wonderful pictures she’d taken with her boyfriend. 

You see, I get incredibly insecure when I see that sort of shit. 

Usually I cry.

That’s the problem with being a romantic idealist. You want your life to be a fairytale; the unobtainable essence in your mind.

We live for the illusion.

Now go chase it, rabbit.
