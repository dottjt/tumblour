I feel bad for reacting so harshly to that anon (I know exactly who it is too). I really don’t think I meant any of that. Anger is a very compelling emotional reaction, which ultimately distorts your ability to react sensibly. I took another person’s words personally; opinions which have nothing to do with my own reality. I am living a false dream. 

I have not been impeccable with my word. I have broken the most important agreement, but that’s okay. The journey is long and winded.

I guess no one’s perfect, but I’m only 21 and I try every day. Some people remain jaded until they die, but I at least strive to change who I am in a way that hopefully promotes harmony. I don’t want to rely on judgement and ideology to guide me free. They are terms for domestication, not peace.

“Life flutters to a stand still and ever so gracefully, returns back from the bliss.”

I’m sorry.
