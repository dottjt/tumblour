This post wasn’t supposed to be called loss. It was supposed to be called logic.

Prior to the tragedy of my own creation, I managed to write this intricate post that honestly, was one of my best works. I was incredibly proud of the prose, the words, the everything. The writing was passionate. Perplexing. Introspective. Masterful. The kind of writing that may only be produced within the heat of the moment. Words, that shall never be murmured again, no matter how much concentration pertained.

Then I lost it.

At first, it was a feeling of shock.

I spent a long time writing it. Editing it. Caressing the curves to their primal instinct. The works. I put part of myself into it, like any good parent would to their art.

It would’ve also severely helped in getting me laid. Yet I lost it.

Then I kind of realised: I’m still here. I still have my arm. Legs. Sixpack. My emotions largely still profess. Everything is just fine. Ultimately, acceptance and that’s what I need in my life. Complete and utter acceptance and it took a trivial loss to realise it. 

This is probably the best thing to have happened to me all day.
