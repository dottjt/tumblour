Something happened to me last night.

I hit rock bottom.

I’d just had my second cigarette and it occurred to me: I don’t want this sort of sadness any more. I don’t want to feel empty and insecure about the way I feel. I don’t want to remain dazed in delusion, as I madly seek solutions in everything but myself. There’s no happiness in drugs. There’s no happiness in being insecure. It’s all illusion to keep you trapped under the addiction of your own desperation.

I want change. I crave it more than anything.

I was masturbating to porn and I was so incredibly desensitized, that I could barely feel anything. The porn just wasn’t erotic enough. Of course, that’s when you start watching the fucked up shit; gang bangs, physical abuse, you name it. Dopamine is not enough, so you crave the adrenaline instead.

Your reward circuitry just don’t give a fuck about you. It just wants the chemicals. You may as well inject them into your blood stream.

I watched this poor white girl, take a black cock so big that she was crying and in extreme physical pain. All the while, the guy filming it is taunting her and making fun of her and it most certainly looked like petty rape to me. Of course, the girl’s desperate for the cash, so she’s forcing it in while she’s crying and the guy comments about how “technically it’s her doing it, not the guy” since she’s the one moving her body, as if to suggest that the whole thing is legitimate. That’s fucked. 

You’re so desperate to feel that you’re willing to watch other people suffer, just so you can get that little kick from their pain. No more. 

This is not how I intend on spending the rest of my life.

You feel so insecure, so down on yourself, so void of clarity and feeling, that you hit an inevitable breaking point. Clearly however, some people don’t. My tolerance for pain ain’t that high, however I don’t quite understand how some people continue to beat themselves up emotionally and physically, for no apparent constructive reason. Call it ignorance. When the heart break is temporary; okay, you’re going through a rough time. Learn from it. Experience the pain. But people who become physically obese beyond words or remain smokers/pot addicts for the rest of their lives or continue their jaded and hateful outlook on life till death.

I couldn’t. I just couldn’t. 

Of course, that’s all bullshit. Empathy is paramount. I would be that fat fucker as well if you put me in their situation, just as I would be the heroin addict or the street whore. We’re a part of this thing called nature and as human beings that makes us all equally vulnerable.

I may be deluded, however I’m still optimistic about my future.

Only because I allow it.

I care. I really do.

When I hit that particular low, I didn’t see it as an excuse to give up. I saw it as an inspiration for motivation; to pick myself up and off of the ground; to take back control of my life. 

Today has been really positive for me and a lot of the fear in my mind has dissolved. Thankfully I’m at advantage in that regard. All that study into self-awareness has come to good use. In fact, after my first break up, I was mostly cured from my madness. I was actually happy with myself. I gave up orgasm for a month and a half, up until I met my second girlfriend. It was a period of growth for me, albeit imperfect in some regard. I was still insecure, deep down inside. 

I was listening to some audio tapes describing gratitude, abdication of power and it all came flooding back. I’m certainly not starting at point blank; I’m probably at least 50% of the way there. The other 50% is securing it. My mind is sorted, however whether I choose to follow it or not, will be the deciding factor in my recovery. I’m so glad I have a framework to follow, because it gives me hope. In fact, hope is bullshit. It’s just an image in your head. What it gives me, is power over who I am. Strength in my quest for change.

Having experienced my recent pain, I don’t think I’ll be heading back any time soon. This is my responsibility. This is my forgiveness to obtain. 

There’s a certain peace in my mind at the moment. It’s brilliant. I’m not going to claim that I’m there yet. Far from it. However I haven’t masturbated today. I haven’t watched porn. I did my homework. I cooked a week’s worth of meals, something which I intended to do days ago.

My mind is clear and proud. I hope you see and feel the love in these words.

Thank you.
