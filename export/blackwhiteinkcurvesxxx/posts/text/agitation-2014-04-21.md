So I have strong feelings for a girl and she also has feelings for me, so that’s great. The positive in all this is that I feel better about myself and I’m super excited for the future. Everything is tinted with a bright sheen of happiness; plastered all over my face like the 4th of July. I’m eating healthy again, exercising and feeling optimistic. The kind of stuff meth is made of. 

The negative is that I’m excited to the point of complete agitation. My spine feels stiff and my body incredibly tense. I can barely hold a thought together and my concentration is completely out of whack. I’m a nervous break down and a shmuck. It sucks.

I sort of sit here and worry. I don’t know what I worry about, but I think it’s about worrying itself. I’m really just waiting for her to respond to my message so that we can speak again. I would love nothing more than to talk to her right now. Maybe I can just pretend to mimic her voice which I masturbate to myself. Uhhhhh, you didn’t just read that.

I think the problem is that I’m so excited and hyped up, that I sort of just want it to all happen all at once. I have no patience. I can already picture her in my lap, as I tell her how pretty she is; my hand sifting diligently through her glorious hair. I feel like I should know her better than I already do.

It feels like I’m stuck in peak hour traffic. It’s like you know where you want to be and that you could be home if the bloody traffic could move a little faster, but alas you’re not. Frustrated and alone.

Fuck.

She’s probably dead.

Oh well, I guess it’s time for me to move on :( :( :(

Maybe I should have a “victory wank” to commemorate her prior existence? Oh, don’t you worry. Victory will reign try all over my tricky hands… I apologise for the image.

I really do need to figure out some sort activity of activity to help distract me (I suppose writing is that default?). I’m thinking of doing my French homework, though that’s a lot easier said than done. I need to do something productive, like flirt (HA?) or jet ski. 

Someone talk to me! I feel like I’m crumbling here. 

Crumble with me baby xx
