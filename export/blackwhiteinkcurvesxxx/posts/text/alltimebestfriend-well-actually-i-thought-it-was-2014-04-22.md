alltimebestfriend well actually, I thought it was quite clever. I’ve discussed everything to a large extent with another person and it’s made me feel much calmer and not so hesitant. I don’t think it’s appropriate to post my further thoughts on here, but I don’t blame her and I really do hope she contacts me soon. It’s too early to make any concrete assumptions at this point and naturally, I’m just insecure and vulnerable about things that involve love/relationships. She’s not the only person that’s been burnt.
