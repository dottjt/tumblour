Oh no, I think I’m… 

Well, you see here folks, I have this slight predisposition towards… fucking things up. It’s not even that fucked up folks, I just can’t grasp it right! 

I can’t sit still. It wasn’t even that much. I swear, it wasn’t. GITTERY GIT. FAT CURSE OF MY WIT. 

So here I sit. Let the anxiety wither into the realm of genes. Everything seems a lot more shallow from a worldly point of view, as the cheese grates so easily onto your tongue. I grated that cheese you fool. I want my cheese back. You ate it without a pretense of care and now you must die. 

I mean, we are mere human… after all is all. are all, gifted with a consciousness that dares see beyond these silly eyes. 

“But sir, my eyes are hardly seeing, nor silly sir!”

Well, that means you must die. 

We should all float for a while. Consider it a due service to the insanity of your mind. 

Reset.
