Question: Continuing on from feminist ask-beware romanticising the past. It sucked. But whatever. Props to you for trying to manage your addiction. You seem to have a really clear sight of it and how you want to combat it and I wish you the best of luck.

Answer: Thank you. 

It’s difficult battling the cognitive dissonance within your mind, however sometimes it’s not a matter of fighting, but rather of acceptance and forgiveness. Perspective is mighty important; you can view Goliath as an insurmountable challenge or this humble target full of exposed weaknesses.
