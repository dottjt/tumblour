Question: As someone who claims to be addicted to porn, do you know much about the porn industry and how damaging porn can be? Not an attacking tone, just curious

Answer: Yes. I’m greatly passionate about this issue. 

I’ve read multiple books on the subject, especially in regards to pornography and addiction, because I believe that’s where most guys, like myself, suffer. 

While I think porn is inherently bad for you (psychologically at the very least) I have no qualms against the pornography industry and I take no moral stance against people who masturbate to porn or produce it. I believe strongly that individual choice should prevail above all else. Only you have the power to help yourself and that’s part of the challenge; learning to live.

Furthermore, I believe this is an issue of addiction, not ethics. Sort the addiction out and everything else will prevail into a more “ethical” equilibrium. 

While orgasm/masturbation CAN be healthy, I’m actually an advocate of abstinence for a number of a reasons, however that’s an issue for another time. Porn is what exacerbates masturbation and leads to desensitisation of the sexual organs, which creates a whole number of issues which rots society down to it’s core. 

In struggling with addiction, I’ve come to realise that the addictive qualities of your abuse are hardly relevant. Rather, if you weren’t so depressed, if you weren’t so anxious, if you weren’t so vulnerable to your own emotions; you’d have no reason for addiction. Of course, changing these circumstances (such as a lack of affection in your life or parental abuse) is the challenging part, not symptoms being displayed. 

I’ve been trying to quit pornography (as well as orgasm, since they go hand in hand) for a few years now and my first successful attempt was earlier this year, when I went a few months without orgasm/porn/masturbation, up until I found a girlfriend. 

I find that when I’m happy and not insecure, I can get away without masturbating/porn/orgasm. However the moment things turn to shit, is when I turn back to masturbating and porn.

I can happily write for a few days on the subject, the science, how the brain works, however I think I’ll leave it here without turning this into a novel.
