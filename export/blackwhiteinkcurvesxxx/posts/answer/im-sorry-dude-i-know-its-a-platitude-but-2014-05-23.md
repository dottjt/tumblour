Question: i'm sorry dude :( i know it's a platitude but you're still so young and you have all the time in the world to have a relationship when the right person comes along. judging by your posts you've been doing really well for yourself recently and you should be proud of that. keep chipping away at your personal achievements and doing the things that make you happy. i've been following your blog so i feel like i actually know you and i genuinely feel for you man :(

Answer: Thanks man. 

I don’t know how I’m going to be feeling for a while, but yeah.
