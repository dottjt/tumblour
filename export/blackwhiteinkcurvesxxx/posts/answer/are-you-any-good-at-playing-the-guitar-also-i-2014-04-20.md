Question: are you any good at playing the guitar? :) also, I really loved your response to my question about you opinion on gay marriage. I've never looked at it that way; thank you for giving me a different outlook on it.

Answer: Here’s the thing. I’ve noticed that I’m a really quick learner.

Just a heads up, I used to be a complete dumbass. I’m not even joking. I used to be really, really stupid. However, once you gain a passion for learning, there’s a lot you can gain from the process itself.

Especially in the process of learning an instrument, you realise there are two things you need to be good at anything: Technique and relaxation. Honestly, if you do those two things, you can just about master anything.

My handwriting used to be terrible. Now I write in amazing cursive. In the past I could barely type. Now I touch type using colemak. You can just about learn anything and no one should think they’re ever stupid, because of their inability. It just means you haven’t figured it out. The brain is neuroplastic in nature. You can get a stroke victim to walk again, as he did before. It takes time and effort.

So to answer your question, I’m not great at guitar. I just don’t play it enough and I only studied it for half a year. Though with that said, I spent a lot of time focusing on my aural ability, which I think is equally as important as learning to play an instrument. If you can’t clearly “hear” the sounds, then it makes it difficult to interpret music. 

I’m glad you enjoy the different perspective. At the end of the day, there is no right or wrong. Everything is merely personal. Sorry if this is long winded, I just love to talk and share.
