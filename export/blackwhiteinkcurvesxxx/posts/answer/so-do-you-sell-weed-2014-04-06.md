Question: so do you sell weed?

Answer: You remind me of those 16 year old teenagers I used to hang out with last year (oh man, so awkward being a 20 year old going to party full of 16 year olds). 

It’s hilarious, because they thought I was all wise n’ shit and I was a terrible role model because I’d be doing massive cones and they’d all give me praise. I remember I’d get random messages from these school kids asking me if I sold weed and I always said no haha. 

Thankfully I don’t smoke weed anymore, though I love my psychedelics. Fuck, it’s been a while since I’ve tripped, but I don’t mind. Time just lowers the tolerance and makes the next experience even more magical (mind you, I used to trip on 25i once every two weeks, so that was quite often). It’s not that I don’t miss it. I just enjoy sobriety as well. They’re both different and wonderful states of mind.
