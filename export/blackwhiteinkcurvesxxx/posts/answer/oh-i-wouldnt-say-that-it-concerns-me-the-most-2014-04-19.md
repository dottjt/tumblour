Question: oh i wouldn't say that it concerns me 'the most', but i am curious, in a sort of 'does the name match the persona' way.

Answer: I know, I know. I’m just trying to be a writer. Lyk, attitude n’ stuff.

I suppose the idea behind this blog was that it’d be a whole bunch of anonymous text and nothing more. Take it for what you will.

Though I will say, I have every intention of getting to know my follwers/people I follow, so it’s not something I’m particularly anal about, however I’m still strict. I’m even thinking of posting ambiguous pictures at some point, though probably not within the foreseeable future.

Perhaps never.

There’s a number of people who know my name and what I look like and I’m completely happy to give out my kik or snapchat to people if they want to contact me in private, however for those who want the core experience, I shall leave them be.

So yeah, I definitely understand your intrigue, however it’s the intrigue that gives this blog power.
