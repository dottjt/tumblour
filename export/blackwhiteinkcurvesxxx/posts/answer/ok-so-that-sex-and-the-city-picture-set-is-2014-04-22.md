Question: Ok so that Sex and the City picture set is actually about the main chicka, Carrie RECEIVING that post-it note from a guy

Answer: ah, I love how people are so involved with my blog ^^

I suppose that’s one perspective, though really, it’s hard to say. That’s just one assumption.

I think she’s just really scared. I think she’s worried about what’s happened in the past and she doesn’t want it to happen again. She’s been so traumatised, so hurt, so bruised, that she’s afraid to let go of her own preconceptions.

Then again, that’s another assumption. I don’t know.

There’s no point in making any assumptions, so I’d rather just flow with the wind until my eventual death into the ether. Either it happens or it doesn’t but by golly gosh, I want this to happen more than anything else in the world right now. No amount of wealth could want her any less.

Though it’s important to distinguish that this is her battle, not mine.

There are four agreements I (try) to abide by in my life, that give me peace. They come from the book The Four Agreements by Don Miguel Ruiz. It’s changed my life from so many different angles, so I recommend it highly. 

- Be impeccable with your word.

- Don’t make any assumptions.

- Don’t take anything personally.

- Try your best.

I shall be impeccable with my word, which is to be happy and embrace life. I shall not make any assumptions, because that is not being self-aware; it is living in fear and doubt. I will not take this situation personally, because her thoughts have nothing to do with me. I will try my best to succeed. 

Cool.
