Question: hey, this is far more courtesy than i think you deserve, but a heads up - the melbourne art scene is a mighty small place and you've said enough about yourself to be pretty much instantly identified. might want to think about taking down a few of your posts. i think you're a tool, but whatever, in a few years you'll look back on what you've written here and cringe, so that's punishment enough

Answer: Iâ€™m just being myself and that makes me happy. 

I wish you best of luck with the future xx
