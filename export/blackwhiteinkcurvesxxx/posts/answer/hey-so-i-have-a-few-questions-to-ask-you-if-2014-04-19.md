Question: hey, so I have a few questions to ask you, if that's okay :) i'm just interested in knowing; 1. are you male, or female, 2. do you play any instruments or sing, and 3. whats your opinion on gay marriage?

Answer: Male. I used to play saxophone/clarinet for 8 years in various bands/orchestras, then I played guitar for a bit and messed around with piano on and off for a number of years; mostly improvisation. People should be free to practice what they’re willing to fight for. I believe in nature i.e. our emotions, not marriage, so I can’t understand why anyone would fight for something that only exists as a construct in people’s minds.

Then again, so is reality.
