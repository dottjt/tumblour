Question: does she have a tumblr or an Instagram or Facebook or anything?

Answer: Well yeah, I met her on tumblr. I could probably get her Facebook using the information I already have, but I don’t see the point. If she’s going to ignore me, then she’s going to ignore me. I need to respect that. I may try and contact her at some point in the future, but she needs her own space. It’s severe for someone to simply cut off another of all contact, so I couldn’t possibly imagine the thoughts going through her head.

This has happened to me before, so I’m rather empathetic about the whole thing. Eh. Life continues it’s trajectory and I’m still me. I still have my arms and my legs. My brain isn’t too fucked by the looks of things, though there’s a slight bulge that looks oddly like a phallus. Gotta love the ‘80s.
