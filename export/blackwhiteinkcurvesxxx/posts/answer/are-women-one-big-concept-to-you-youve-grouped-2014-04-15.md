Question: Are women one big concept to you? You've grouped them all into one box and that's a big fucking no-no. They're human beings and individuals and fuck you for saying that most lack 'intellectual finesse'. I for one don't have time for all that pomp and flourish bullshit to make me seem intellectual.  Get a reality check.

Answer: Yes, I did group them into a massive box and that’s a big fucking yes-yes and you know what, I’m also going to round up all the guys into a big fucking box and say that they too lack ‘intellectual finesse’. Happy now?

THIS ISN’T GENDER SPECIFIC.

Deal with it.

I’ve met exactly one girl who blew me away with her logic and GUESS WHAT??!? I too have met only one guy who was of the same equivalent, so thar you have it.

Both equally delusional, just as I am. Though I suppose stereotypes don’t matter, ey?

Individualism implies exactly nothing about character. It is a complete non-sequitur. Everyone is an individual. So what?

You call it bullshit. I call it reality.

Fair. E-nough.
