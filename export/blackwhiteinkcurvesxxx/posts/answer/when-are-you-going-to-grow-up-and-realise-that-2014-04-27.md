Question: when are you going to grow up and realise that women arent meant for your pleasure? please stop addressing women as if they're some sort of object to be used for sex and love.

Answer: If you’ve ever been in a relationship before, you’ll notice that it’s an equal union between two people. Do you really think that in such a union, the girl isn’t receiving pleasure herself? That I’m not showing her my care and affection? Do you really have such a view that men just take and give nothing back?

If so, you’re a bigger cynic than me. Well done.

I’ve been fucked around, but I’m not going to simply say that all women are massive cunts. The fact is, everyone gets fucked around; women and men. The sad thing, is that you do most the fucking yourself. These are your insecurities, not theirs you’re dealing with. It’s just about finding someone compatible. 

I don’t care though, I’m going to keep trying until I find what I want and guess what? I’ve done it before. Twice within the past eight months. That’s more than most people can claim. Fuck. It was a complete bitch, but I did it and you can bet your ass that you didn’t “use” women in order to get their love and affection. It’s never worked like that.

If that’s been your experience with relationships, then fine. It’s your life to suffer.

Listen. If the girl doesn’t want it, that’s okay. It was never going to develop into love in the first place, because of the two very different sets of insecurities. It’s entirely voluntary and I respect that. In fact, I respect it to the point that I’m not going to flatout lie to and manipulate a girl, unlike all my other friends, because I know love doesn’t function like that. I’m the nice guy. I make it hard on myself because I want something more. That’s more than most guys can say.

Just because I’m dying for affection and I’m yet to also meet a girl who’s equally as desperate, isn’t a reflection on what love/relationships are as a construct. It’s a highly individualised realm.

I’m sorry for having a shit time with life. Fuck you.
