Question: "If there is anything unhealthy in your reactions, just bear in mind that sickness is the means by which an organism frees itself from what is alien; so one must simply help it to be sick, to have its whole sickness and to break out with it, since that is the way it gets better." -Rilke

Answer: That’s one perspective, though I take a very different view. I believe sickness is itself alien. 

Reactions are caused by one’s actions, which is to say they can be equally reversed by one’s own re-actions. I think the flawed assumption in your quote, is that it makes it out to seem that sickness is necessary in the context of something other than itself. It completely denotes personal responsibility to prevent sickness. Sickness is only necessary if you’re in the reaction, however you can only be sick if you let yourself get to that point.

This is where self-awareness fits in.

If you’re truly self-aware, then you cannot have an unhealthy emotional reaction because negativity is borne out of lies. I believe that anything that is a deviation away from happiness and peace is not normal. Period. Much easier said than done.

To me, sickness is not a solution. It’s a simple a self-perpetuating coping mechanism. Furthermore, sickness in the context of your quote creates the idea that it is necessary for function, as I said earlier. I do not believe it is. It will help you get through your trauma, however it will not change the way you feel about yourself. Self-awareness will. (I mean this in the context of mental illness, mind you)

So yes. While your premise is correct, it is a mere pathway. Not an ultimate solution.
