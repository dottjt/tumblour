Question: Anyway, forgive the analysis, I suppose that's why you have an anon blog where all your thoughts can go. It's interesting to see your weaknesses and strengths laid out openly. You seem really nice, but you've been exposed to viewpoints that, in many others, would manifest in very toxic ways? :P You may have a lot to learn (wow patronising much hah, sorry) but you are someone who will never stagnate but continue to grow so long as you trust your instincts & surround yourself with good people. :)

Answer: Put it this way; you don’t have to agree with my points of view, however that doesn’t mean you cannot appreciate the person writing these words. Consider that I’m a respectful individual who has a genuine care for people. I’m non-violent. I’m passionate about life. I always try my best to be a good person, even if I do not believe in morals. I’m not filled with an intense hate or negativity. I’m not overly opinionated and I don’t try to force my point of view down people’s throats.

Sure, my logic may go against your own, but instead of battling with your own ideology, why not look at the whole picture instead of the discription? I may not be perfect, however I feel like I’ve accomplished a lot in the way of desirability. 

On the other hand, you have many people who are feminist or religious, who don’t have these qualities. I’m not trying to stereotype, however what I’m suggesting is that actions speak a lot louder than words and I hope my actions reflect that.
