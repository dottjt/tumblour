Question: I feel like I used to know you, but I  don't think I did. I don't know. Maybe I'll write to you off anon when I get the guts. I love the honesty in your words. Hi from a fellow Melbournian.

Answer: Chances are, we may have conversed multiple times within the past. Of course, I’m not going to tell you that; there’s a reason why this blog is largely anonymous.

This will have been my 4th tumblr blog within the past year or so and it’s quite possible that you took a disliking to me the very few times we met; each with a different face. It’s funny how people receive you differently when you present yourself within the various forms allowed. 

I’ve managed to befriend a lot of the “initially skeptical” people this time round, so I’m quite pleased. People who thought I was once complete dirt; now take a liking to the subtly of my keyboard. Naturally they’re none-the-wiser.

I’m a nice guy when things come around to it and perspective don’t bite. I’m also being a massive douche with my words atm, so please, bite away.
