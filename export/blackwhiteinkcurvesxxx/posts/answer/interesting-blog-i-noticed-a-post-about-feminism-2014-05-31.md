Question: Interesting blog. I noticed a post about feminism and... Well, thanks to feminism I can hook up with guys without marriage, & not be called a slut. It's taught me to approach guys first. It's probably benefited you. Just putting that out there.

Answer: Likewise, you can say the same thing about religion and how it’s helped society develop into a complex civilization. I don’t necessarily think that the end justifies the means, however I’m not one to comment of the chronology of human history.

It simply “is” and that’s an important thing to understand. 

Listen, I think that feminism is a necessary evil. Undoubtedly, it’s done some wonderful things for society and women, but personally speaking, I think any sort of ideology is tainted, be it socialism, capitalism, vegetarianism etc. 

Anything that ends in an -ism is going to end you in disaster. Common sense on the other hand, is still a long way away from becoming a global standard, so ideologies are necessary within the meantime to organise people most fashionably and impeccably. Of course, to what extent is everything human nature? Only time will tell. 

In the ultimate end game of humanity; perhaps 10,000 years, possibly 1 million years into the future (assuming we last that long, which I don’t think we will), I get the sense that humans will view feminism as a barbaric relic, just as religion and patriarchy was. 

I know that’s a very radical thing to say, but that’s just my view on reality.
