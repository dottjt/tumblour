Question: And that is totally normal. Sometimes things just aren't right and they weren't supposed to work but there is nothing wrong with you and you don't need another girl to make you feel worthy. I learned this the hard way I guess, constantly seeking attention of any kind but still feeling empty. The emptiness won't go away unless you learn to see your own worth and understand that your emotions are the most important.  I won't be offended if you don't want to post this. Xx

Answer: Well, that’s very nice of you.

See, I don’t think I’ve ever really been happy, prior to experiencing my first relationship. I think independence or “self-love” is bullshit, because everyone is dependent on something. TV shows, fandoms, video games, comfort food, self-rejection, drugs etc. 

And you know what? I don’t want to do any of those things (except occasionally for drugs recreationally) and I’ve only ever achieved the sort of productive lifestyle when I was in a relationship. Prior to that, I was still high achieving, however it was never sustainable. You’d have one month of happiness, then another month of utter depression and it’s just not that fun. I’m the kind of guy who likes to read, learn, grow and everything inbetween. I don’t want to watch TV to get my kick. I would rather share my time and be cute with a girl.

I used to take a lot of drugs before I discovered love and when I was “independent”, however I wasn’t particularly happy. In fact, I was depressed most of my life, in-spite of my “magnificent” achievements. I stopped smoking the weed since my first relationship and I haven’t gone back since. Also, being in a relationship has proven effects on well-being, especially in regards to oxytocin. That’s probably the drug that has changed my life the most (perhaps even more than psychedelics).

It wasn’t until I discovered love that I felt truly happy with who I was. At least that’s where I’m coming from.

In a sense, it’s all I’ve ever wanted.
