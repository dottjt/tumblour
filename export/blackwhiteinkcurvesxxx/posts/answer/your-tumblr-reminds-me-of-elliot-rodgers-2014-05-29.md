Question: Your Tumblr reminds me of Elliot Rodger's manifesto and we've posted your Tumblr URL to our Subreddit on PUA's. We hope you don't mind us making you feel even worse than you do now.

Answer: Do you honestly think it makes me feel worse? 

I’m incredibly proud of who I am. I’m incredibly proud of my flaws. I’m incredibly proud of my achievements. Sure. I’m not going to deny that I’m sometimes blinded by my own delusion, but that’s just growing up. It takes real courage to question your own beliefs and that’s why I’m constantly changing as a person. It’s the reason I get results. 

People are too quick to blame others for their failures, rather than congratulate them on their achievements. Of course, you don’t know who I am. You don’t know about my failures or my success. For all you know, I could already have a girlfriend. You’re too narrow-minded to consider the possibility. 

The difference is, I’m not cynical. The difference is, I’ve been getting pussy. The difference is, I’ve been going on dates. The difference is, I’ve been meeting girls who are now good friends of mine and appreciate me for who I am, even if they don’t want to be in a relationship. 

You can beat me down (and trust me, with the amount of shit I’ve gone through, I’d be standing here a proud Elliot Rodger Junior with a patriot flag in both hands) but no matter how hard the fight, I will always defend my right for a better life and I will always bounce back, no matter how much you kick me down.

I don’t hate women. As much as some women hate me and think I’m dirt, at no point have I ever thrown in the towel and said, “Fuck it. Women are shit. I’m just going hate women for the rest of my life and pretend like that’s going to solve everything.” I’m not a cynic. I’m a fighter and I’ll fight till I find that girl who doesn’t treat me like shit and loves me for who I am. 

If you REALLY knew me as a person, you’d know that I’m incredibly kind and considerate. I care for people. I go out of my way to help others. I may sometimes SEEM a little insane, but let’s be honest, we all are. If you can’t handle the honesty, then perhaps you’re barely honest with yourself. That’s your problem, not mine.

Very few people are willing to admit their own insanity and that’s what I love about this blog. We all go through the same shit, yet we’re all too afraid to tell it how it is. We all feel incredibly weak and vulnerable at times, yet we cower like children to our own adult lives. 

I’m not afraid to expose myself. Read it loud and clear. 

So please, where the fuck is your 56,000 word blog. Where the fuck is your literary talent. You know why I suffer? You know why I put myself through hell? You know why I’m highly insecure? 

It’s because I love life. 

I’m so fucking passionate about who I am and the experiences I want to enjoy, that I can’t even go a fucking day without embracing the fear and detriment I carry within my heart.

There’s only one person in this life that has ever allowed myself to feel shit and that person is ME. So fuck off and stop wasting my time and guess what buddy. I was right. This is my epiphany and it’s been a pleasure facilitating with you.

*crowd cheers*
