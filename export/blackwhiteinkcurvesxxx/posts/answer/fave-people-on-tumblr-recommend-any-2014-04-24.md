Question: Fave people on tumblr? Recommend any?

Answer: Ummm well, I basically like text blogs written in the style I’ve supposed, but I’m yet to find one quite like it, unfortunately. 

The closest thing I know is inkquotes.tumblr.com but I dunno. He kinda just disappeared and that was a real shame. There was also a tktx… something, but he disappeared as well. I’m also a big fan of sweetcherryerotica.tumblr.com

I like writers and there very seldom seems to be any serious writers on tumblr. Though if anyone does a writing blog, please do hit me up!
