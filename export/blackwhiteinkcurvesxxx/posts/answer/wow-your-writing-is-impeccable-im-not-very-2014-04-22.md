Question: wow, your writing is impeccable. I'm not very active on tumblr anymore, but it feels like I want to catch up on reading your posts daily because it's so enthralling haha. Tips to improve please?

Answer: Oh, thank you ^^

I guess that’s the intention. To create a product so raw and heartfelt, that it redefines the regurgitated purpose of your own desire and pain. People don’t just want the facts. They want the emotions. The desperation. The very blood as it pours out of your eyes.

You can only really get good at something if you have a passion for it. I love to write. I’ve been writing online since I was 14 and it’s the most effective way for me to sift through my problems. In fact, so much so, that my passion for writing completely dies once I find love. It becomes this barbaric relic to me. I have no thoughts to express; I am at peace. This is in fact, why this is my fourth tumblr blog. The cycles come and go.

Practice. Practice. Practice. Honestly, I can write thousands of words a day and not get bored. I actually write a lot more than I post, it’s just that some of the topics I don’t think would concern this tumblr audience.
