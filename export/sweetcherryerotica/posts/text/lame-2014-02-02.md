So it turns out I was being played all along by this girl on Tumblr. I was talking to this other guy and it turns out we both had the same experience with the exact same girl.

I’ll give her credit though. She was very, very convincing. Though who knows, it could have possibly been genuine, though it’s hard to say. Deception most likely, though I cannot see any reason why, simply judging from her character.

I think it’s that she has serious trust and attachment issues, not to mention trauma from her past. For that I cannot blame her. Forgiveness is the first step towards acceptance and if I’m to truly let go, I must detach myself.

Oh well, life moves on and it’s not the first time I’ve been taken advantage of, so meh. When you think about it, it’s actually very difficult to be mad at an opportunity that was never really an opportunity in the first place.

Since her approach was a ruse, so were my feelings and thus, sanity restored biatches.
