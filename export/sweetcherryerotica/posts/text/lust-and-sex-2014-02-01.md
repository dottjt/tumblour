I think the overwhelming problem with lust and sex is that it’s sold entirely as an image, which often has very little to do with the real thing. I mean, you can see a picture of a kinky babe and it can make you feel a certain way, however to actually touch the real thing and form a connection with that babe, requires a different sort of commitment.

It’s part of the reason why I gave up pornography. It completely killed sex for me. Porn is a type of hype-reality which distorts the actual act of sex, to the point where I found it dull. In fact, you become more excited by the prospect of sex (the image) than the actually doing of your disgrace.

After all, humans aren’t directly concerned with their circumstance. At the end of the day, we all just die for that feeling. You could have everything materially and mentally in your own little world, but unless if you own the associated feeling, you will always end up feeling inadequate about yourself. 

That’s why I refrain from consumerism and ego. I know it can’t make me happy, because I’m ultimately responsible for my own emotions, not that in which I place faith. In fact, I’ve given up a vast majority of the vices which once plagued my land.

Yet for some reason, I still wish to chase that image. Not in belief, but in fabrication. I already know how to create subtle imagery with words, however I’m yet to master the visual aspect of it’s creation.

“Trample vivid in the motions of your intent. My silly fingers eat buckets from your forebode.”

Too easy.
