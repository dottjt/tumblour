Let me tear down those walls. From life we create death; induced miasma and pain. The illusion is your grace to lose, pandered wish diced magic. I’m surprised you even have the will to see me by name; the image of your detriment. I force you down to the floor. You crumble like brittle ice, succumbing to the tradition of your forefathers. Your weakness sells souls, dear. It’s the freak within you, distorted only with shame. I place myself inside you.

Running will only make it hurt more.
