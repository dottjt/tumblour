Dear Laura,

I’ve never loved a girl as gorgeous as you before. In fact, I’ve never loved a girl before, quite the way I love you now. I didn’t even know this sort of love was possible until I met you. Most certainly you’ve changed my life. You helped me discover the love I was so willing to give, yet unable to express. 

My love is insignificant without you. You make love enjoyable, not tedious. You don’t make love feel like a chore. You make love feel like something special; beyond even the chemicals flowing within my brain.

You make it feel like magic.

I didn’t know who I was before you. I felt lost. I felt insecure. I felt as if I were the biggest failure in my own world of hate and deprivation. I tried my hardest to love, only to have my emotions twisted and destroyed. I built gods out of my love, yet never true companions to appreciation. It was never true love, only a construction of delusion to my desperation; love that later translated to pain and suffering; love resembling fear.

These are not the things love are made of.

I gave up my entire life to love and be loved, and happily, I shall give it up again. Yet in having these experiences, I now know where I went wrong. It wasn’t because of my desperation. It wasn’t because I hated myself or that life wasn’t worth living. 

I was simply craving for a love like ours. The kind of love dreams are made of. The kind of love that feels just… right. 

I knew I had it in me to love. I knew I was capable of something more, to give and receive, in the holiest fashion possible. All I need was you; a girl who could relate to my misery and laugh at the hilarity in my pain. 

You are my perfect girl, certainly beyond these individual words. 

Your love helped me discover a large part of what was missing from my life. All that emotion and happiness I was denied. All those feelings of self-rejection and pain. The humiliation. The failure. You were the cure to my void. 

Your simple presence fills me with a complex joy that no amount of words can describe. You are an angel to my eyes and it’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever had the pleasure of experiencing, visually and mentally. You make me feel alive and purposeful. You accept me for who I am and you love me for my quirks and shortcomings. You make me so ridiculously happy for who I am. Your compassion is like ecstasy. 

I couldn’t have asked for me. You ARE perfect. 

You’re the girl I’ve always desired. You’re funny. You’re smart. You’re cute. We can make fun of each other and be stupid together. I mean, we can just sit there and have fun. We don’t have to worry about what we look like or the inner demons which try to tear us apart. We can just exist in each other’s arms and feel each other’s love for the greatness it represents: us. 

I could lie in bed with you for hours, simply to feel the warmth from your skin. Never has there been a better pleasure to grace my soul. 

I’ve never felt awkward with you. I’ve never felt a hint of tension, hate, negativity, anger, sadness, in our short time together. You’ve only ever made me smile. I have never felt any malice with you. You make me feel so warm and comfortable. It makes me want to be with you more. 

We only ever love and it’s the most amazing, open and honest love I’ve ever experienced; certainly the most pure love to have entered my world. 

Though you’re more than just a thought in my mind: you’re the perfect reality; the kind of reality I want to experience again and again, forever and ever. 

I love the way you speak. I love it when you act all cute and adorable. I love the innocence in your portray. It is by far the most lovely voice I have ever heard. Your voice provides me with a warmth which makes me feel safe and comfortable. It excites me and leaves me wanting for more. It conveys a personality which is as much as part of my soul, as my very own body. 

I think it’s stupid to say we’re both infallible, that including the love we have for each other. Neither of us are perfect and our past’s certainly aren’t pretty, however what makes us special is our willingness to try our best. We made our love special. We made it into something adorable and magical. 

We made it happen and it’s a commitment which has bought us unfound happiness. So there’s no reason to ever feel sad or bad about ourselves. As long as we have each other and we try our best, nothing can let us down. Our love wouldn’t have been possible if we didn’t try our best.

I want you to feel every single inch of my love and I want that love to turn you into be the happiest, most positive version of yourself that you have ever realised.

Because my dear Laura, you are all the things I written above and more. All you need is the courage to realise it. I will make you into my brave, little girl.

“Though my love be plain and ordinary, your stature be so great, that any compliment which hath your blessing, shall be more paramount than the entire wealth of my soul.

I love you like fire, for you are the fire in my heart.”

I love you baby, like you cannot imagine
