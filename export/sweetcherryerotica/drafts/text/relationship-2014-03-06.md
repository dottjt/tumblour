So I’ve been together with my special girl for around a month now and it’s been literally everything we’ve both ever wanted. I treat her right and we both have a chemistry that molds into a friction-less effort of love and cherish. We’re so happy together and the best thing is that it’s not an intense form of attachment. It doesn’t feel unhealthy, like in my past relationships.

It’s funny to think of all the girls who found 

The thing I really appreciate about being in-love, is the experience it offers you 

However the way I see it, is that if a girl is timid, then she’s probably just not for me. If she’s insecure or immediate seeks her “slut sensor” then chances are, she’s not going to like me touching her violently in public. I don’t like that kind of girl, because I’m not that kind of guy. 

Trust is vital in any relationship and that’s the basis for how I get it to flow.
