“Titter, tatter, Kelly, splatter, she’s the girl for me. Her beauty shines like rays of light, your heart my beacon shall be.”

Then I look into your eyes. I’m returned with a cute smile, as you glance back with a framed silliness. I’m struck with awe at the demeanor of your silence; I must make you mine. Your face turns awkwardly to the corner of the floor; desperately hoping for the hardwood sheen to take me away from your thoughts. Yet, my dear little princess, an uncontrollable smile occupies the well-natured lush in your pretty, cascading eyes. You stand there helpless, like a luscious greek goddess, waiting for her tale to be told. I shall be the hero that ignites your passion, like no other man before. 

I approach you with a feint confidence, scripture in hand; the lexicon of your knowledge in helm. You pretend not to notice as I stride to your realm; your blush a rosy red. I grab you by the hand and pull you in suddenly; bodies touching and all. I remember your breasts feeling soft on my chest; the contrast is ours to hold.

I can feel your hair poking me playfully in the face, as we embrace ourselves in this little world we’ve conceived. You shake nervously as I stand in front of you, human to human, staring intently at the prizes in our hearts. There’s not a single thing I’d ever do to miss this moment; not for all the wealth in the world. You whimper to a cultivated coldness, but I reassure you with my touch. I brush your shoulder ever so lightly with the grace of my neck, as you latch peacefully to the love I’ve provided. I place my head in your shoulders, sensing your beauty with all it’s metaphysical delight. We elegantly dance into the moonlight; jazz ensemble and all. We are the centre of attention at the debutante ball; the cutest couple of all.

We sway glamorously like a pair of entwined caterpillars; the stars of this perfect night. The ultimate accessories that god has offered, to the perfection that fine taste has sought. I bow down and kiss your hand. You stare at me with a fervour of gold; your eyes watering to hope. You’re heavy with lust and love and appreciation; you glimmer with self-acceptance.

You want me. You need me. You rush at my jaw with the tips of your fingers and we passionately converse with the perfection of our lips. We have everything we need. Everything we desire. The lust in our hearts and the flaws in our actions. We have an each and other and more.
