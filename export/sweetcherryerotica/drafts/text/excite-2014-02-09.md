Oh gee, what a mesmerizing title for the wrinkle in my thigh. It’s as if my words are trying to communicate with you dear; perhaps a subtle hint of recollect misogyny, floating awry into palettes of murky green…

I think the problem with most guys is that they don’t know how to excite woman, and sex is quite indicative of this fear/shame. They don’t know how to use their fingers during sex. They don’t know how to manhandle and make them squeal. They don’t understand that intricacies of tease and romance. Some guys just lie there on top of their girl, fucking her, as she withers away into a plethora of type two boredom: zombie. 

Girls aren’t princesses. They want to have fun too. They’re just as horny as guys, if not worse. They like to fantasise. They also want to be swept off their feet and taken away into a world of pleasure and it really ain’t that hard to dom. 

Sure, there are certain boundaries, but I basically do whatever I would find really kinky if done to me. 

I barely penetrate during sex, yet it could be more amazing in retrospect. I think sex is killed for a lot of people, because it simply didn’t meet their expectation
