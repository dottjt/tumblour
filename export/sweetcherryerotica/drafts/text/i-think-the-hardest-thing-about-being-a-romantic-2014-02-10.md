I think the hardest thing about being a romantic, is finding a girl who likes to have fun, but also isn’t a complete emotional wreck. Of course, I don’t mean this as a judgement against others and mental illness is a terrible state for anyone to be in and it’s completely understandable and deserves empathy. 

I was really, really bad in so many different ways. I was incredibly judgmental, I was really depressed, I felt like a failure in so many different ways, I was insecure beyond belief, social events made me anxious, as well as the whole plethora of attitudes which may be considered mental illness. 

The way I see it, is that all these things are a challenge to overcome. I don’t really believe mental illness is real, it’s simply a reactionary construct. What I mean to say, is that yes, it FEELS very real and your emotions do drive you, however your emotions are orchestrated by your beliefs, not the other way around. 

Beliefs actually aren’t very difficult to change. It’s simply a matter of technique, though most people don’t ever get that far. It’s like realising that you can think outside the box, yet arguably, most people don’t realise they’re in a box to begin with, hence why they struggle for the rest of their life. 

I feel so incredibly lucky I got out of my box. The process actually is quite simple, however it’s coming to that very realisation you’re inside a box, which is truly the most difficult. People ask all the wrong questions and they wonder why they get the wrong answers. 

I don’t doubt that some people struggle harder than others, however that doesn’t validate your condition anymore than others. I feel very lucky in that I managed to sort out my problems very early on in life. Most people spend their entire lives struggling and they never hit that moment of epiphany that there’s an easy way to live. 

You see so many women with the most beautiful souls, yet you know that it’s a pointless endeavor on your behalf. There’s no point creating an uneven union. It creates way too many problems for both parties. Basically, if you cannot first love yourself, you’re in no state to love others. It just creates more problems in the long run. 

Humans are the only animals who make the same mistake again and again continually, and still don’t change. 

However the solution is remarkably the same in every case, though certainly not painless. 

People think in terms of “dealing” with their problems, as opposed to truly relinquishing them from their lives. They create ego to compromise. They hide behind their identity to feel safe. Yet under these pretenses, they can never truly be free of their fears. They can only pretend.
