Your beauty kills silence as it burns through my bones. It teases and flounders with a precision that groans. Those broken wings radiate your subconscious torture; like fireworks of evil reigning dumb on my soul. Glittering so violently in the tears of my hope; your explosion is savior to the taste of my grope. My dead body lies in the past of your shame; to the blackness of dinner: my heart is your fame.

Your luscious grey shadow growls unsettling with cruelty; always in opposition to boys, like the one at your heels. I beg you and you scream from the fear of my eyes; suggestive your wink is towards your sweet lies. Like a runway to heaven, you prey and you scour; overcoming me dumbfound with your shroud blind whore.

You sit on my lap and you grab me like guilt. I’m frozen and petty with anxiety like prone. Gathering my strength with the power I behold, you trample me stupid within the walls of my throne.

Your mouth makes it’s way to the base of my lips, yet you slap me like silly to the sign of your tease. Your naughty little boy; my teacher unknown. Anything for your squeal; the punishment my own. You push me to the floor and you rip off my clothes. I’m vulnerable and naked.

I’m very much yours.
