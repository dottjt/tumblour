There are no such things as rights.

You do not have the right to be happy. You do not have the right to an education. You do not have the right to live.

However you do have the privilege and it’s something you certainly shouldn’t take for granted. 

Only nature has the right and the privilege over your life and you most certainly have limited influence over your surroundings.

I can kill you right now. Yes, you can claim justice by locking me up, however ultimately I have eliminated your right, fair and square. 

People get so worked up over morals.
