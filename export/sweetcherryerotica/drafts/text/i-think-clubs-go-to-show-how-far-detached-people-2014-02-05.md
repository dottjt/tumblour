I think clubs go to show how far detached people are from reality.

People go to clubs for one very simple reason: They’re a sucker for image. They eat image like it’s candy for breakfast. It drives them. They see a picture of a hot girl and they fluster like a helicopter. They imagine themselves on a beach in the Bahamas and like the close pan of a cute baby seal, they’re in a state of paralytic consumption: peace. 

They are fools.

You know kids, there’s a very simple reason why I’m not insecure. Put simply, I don’t have an overwhelming sense of ego. In other words, I don’t have any images of who I should be in my mind. The kicker: I also don’t have any images of who I shouldn’t be.

A little thing called self-esteem. 

You see, ego is the biggest cause of self-rejection. In your mind, you have that “perfect” image of yourself and who you should. That’s what drives you. However, you also have an “imperfect” image of yourself and who you shouldn’t be. Every time you fail to meet your perfect image, your images of imperfection haunt you and that is the cause of your self-rejection and emotional pain.

Expectation vs reality. The number one cause depression and negativity worldwide. 

Here’s a better way of thinking that doesn’t cause emotional pain: Simply being self-aware. If you are self-aware in the moment, you have no worries, fears or regrets. No guilt, anxiety, trauma. You’re living the moment and loving life as it transpires. Not obsessing over the future or the past.

The second part to this all, is to learn to unconditionally love yourself and everything. That’s a little more complex and I’m not quite there yet.

People go to clubs because they seek that “feeling”. It’s the reason why we want to do anything, so we can feel a particularly way about ourselves. Yet if you ditch the ego and you’re already happy with yourself, then what is the desire to go to clubs? You already have that feeling. You’re already complete.

Destroy the images. Destroy the ego. Regain your personal power.
