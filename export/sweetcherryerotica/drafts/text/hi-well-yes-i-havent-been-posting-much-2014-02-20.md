Hi, 

Well, yes. I haven’t been posting much lately, if anything at all. I feel no need to prescribe to the agreements I once made in my mind. 

It’s a very… fantastical notion, to realise that opinions need not be voiced, let alone received. The various persons on tumblr have a certain sickness; a sickness that comes in many different shapes and sizes. Call it a sickness of the mind.

I was once sick. Oh yes, forever obsessed with this and that; in complete negligence of the reality which I am now to embrace. A very vague notion indeed, though the details are unimportant. They are not mine to share. 

My recovery began immediately after finishing high school and like all journeys, that being the journey of life, the path is neither linear nor fair. Though the bumpier the better. It helps in develops that facet called ‘control’. 

Now I am self-aware. I am in control of my life. I can do just about anything my mind demands. 

I want to learn to speed read. I want to become an arbiter of technical analysis. I want to absorb information like the surrounds they bathe. 

You see, control is a very basic tenant of an individual’s experience. It’s the default state: the humanity you’re born with. When you’re in control, you essentially choose how you feel and the ways you wish to seek. Of course, as you grow older from birth, you’re preached rules and cultural varieties to follow.

Enter mental illness. 

It’s such a contrast, the person I am today. I used to be very judgmental. Now it actually hurts to be critical, because of the personal power it gives away. Personal power that could be spent developing my happiness. Why waste your time being unhappy? Some people are weird. 

Now I am free. I’m no longer shackled by fear or by inadequacy.
