Indecent exuberance sings abuse of your command. I’m brainwashed like candy. Eat me; I demand. Your cute silhouette burns my intellect to mush. It want you like ecstasy, in my bones; oh the rush.

The precision in your eyes distort judgment and glee. One minute I’m begging. The next at your knees. I’m pulling and tearing, at your body forebode. Your hurt drives me crazy. My inflict is just so.

Point me to death girl; my peasure is your sword. Your fishnet wounds tightly like the weapon that you hoard. It stretches and laughs as you struggle from within. Your suffocation sells hope that your sex is a sin. It pulls and it stretches, so violently on your whim. It sticks to your skin, dripping wet like your chest. Your body so pretty, like a whore to molest.

You squeal as I squish. You Squirm as I pretend. Your temple is my playground. My play thing; no end.

You grasp at my outline. You fight till you faint. My pleasure has no bound, to the ravage you hate. You’re dumb and you’re little. My pet to be fucked. Don’t bite or I’ll hit you. Play dead or go suck.

Don’t worry cute soldier. Your daddy earnt your soul. To hold you and touch you, like a slut with no gold. My soft lips kiss slowly; my tongue through your hair. I sing you and sweet you, not that I too care.

I’ll tell you you’re gorgeous. I’ll give you my love. My sweet little angel, for our lust and my love.
