I like to tease with my fingers. 

Most guys don’t understand how to excite a girl. That’s why you don’t play games when it comes to making love. The moment you project insecurity/lie about something you’re uncomfortable with, or put on a false image of yourself, is the moment you decided to limit the possibility of what you can explore. 

Gee, I mean, who doesn’t want to be manhandled? 

My cute Laura is gorgeous. She’s a big girl and tell her how much I love her curves. Oh, they’re so luscious and tell her they’re beautiful and that she has nothing to be ashamed of.
