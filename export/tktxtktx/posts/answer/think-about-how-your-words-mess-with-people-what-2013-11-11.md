Question: Think about how your words mess with people. What you wrote about Amelia has the power to hurt her, you pretend like you know her better than she knows herself but that's complete bullshit. Write whatever pretentious bull you want about the other aspects of your life (how dare you use "blue" with "depression," the implications of that word are a stark contrast to the reality of depression). She's out of your life, just leave it that way and stop being a dick about it all.

Answer: Firstly, I don’t see how I’m being a dick about anything. At no point do I condemn her or say anything bad about her. In fact, I glorify her for who she is. All I’m doing is writing about our life, which doesn’t relate to your external experience between us. 

Secondly, everything I’ve written about Amelia thus far, has already been discussed in great detail, not just with her in person, but also on my previous blog. I used to write intricate posts about our life, our relationship and who she was, which she also was a reader of. 

You have to understand that we didn’t have a very typical relationship. It was open, honest, though brutal at times, which is why there was a sense of attraction. A large part of her life consists of being something she isn’t, yet we managed to break through that. There wasn’t one aspect about her life she didn’t feel uncomfortable expressing to me. A vast majority of it is incredibly nasty, from her family, to her relationships, to her person. 

I’m sure you’re provoked because you knew her at some point and got a different picture of her. Listen, I’m not doubting that. But you have to understand that there’s a lot about her life which is particularly revolting and there’s very few things she’s willing to openly express. If you knew everything about her, from the nitty to the gritty, I’m sure, in fact I guarantee, you wouldn’t be so offended. I say this as a friend of hers. 

The only reason she left was because she moved to a different state and had so much else in her life to look forward to and cherish. She contacted me recently, so it’s not like she’s forgotten. 

Oh yes, how dare I use words that don’t fit the imagery in your head. How dare I express the false reality in my head, also known as my imagination. I don’t complain when I see big breasted girls on the TV that don’t fit my conception of women. How dare you attack other people’s perception. How dare you not empathise with other people, simply because you disagree. I would call that a severe case of hypocrisy. My words are an attempt at entertainment, not some kind of spiritual realm into the abacus. 

… and yes, I’ve had depression. Everyone’s experience is different. My words are how I relate to the world around me. I am not responsible for the way you receive them. Comprehension is a bitch.
