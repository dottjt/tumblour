Question: I complained because she told me that what you write about her hurts her, and I care a lot about her. Whether or not she lives in the same state has nothing to do with the state of your relationship. Just because you think you glorified her does not mean you weren't a dick. You presented an image that she doesn't agree with. That makes you a dick.

Answer: You know what? Fair enough. I’m a dick and I’m not going to deny that I haven’t been a dick in the past on more than one instance, but it doesn’t mean I’m a bad person or that I don’t try to at least rectify what is a symptom of my own personality. Basically, I’d rather be exposed than in denial. I apologise. 

Though I think I know what you’re referring to. I did write this one thing that was completely untrue, but it was incredibly convoluted at that point between us and both of us ended up getting hurt and in the wrong. But as I said, we already had a long discussion about it and we’re over it. 

With that said, you can’t just say I’m a dick without recognising her problems as well. No one is truly innocent.
