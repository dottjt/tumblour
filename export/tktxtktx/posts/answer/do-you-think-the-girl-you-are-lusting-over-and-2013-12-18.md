Question: Do you think the girl you are lusting over and yourself have a future together? Or is it just all sex?

Answer: It’s impossible to say. I thought me and Mimi had a future together, but that obviously didn’t turn out as planned.

I almost feel that everything in my life is short-lived, which is why I’m a little worried about this girl. Something unexpected always comes along to ruin my plans. In very few cases have things ever worked out as expected, but it’s something I’ve learnt to embrace and simply appreciate. Chaos is the essence of life, though it always seems to turn out in my favor. I mean, I did end up with this girl after all. 

I think if it’s one thing I’ve learnt from this website I’ve been following, it’s to just be grateful for what you have and not take things for granted. 

I think this girl I’m lusting over is something special. Perhaps I don’t realise it now, but I think I will later. It’s funny, because I’m yet to actually hear her voice or even meet her in person. But from what I can tell, she’s a really kind, loving and genuine person. She works with kids, so there you go haha. 

In her own words: 

“That’s why I promise to give you everything I know, in every different way to let you have the full experience. That is another reason why I want to fuck you, I want to open the door that shows you what it feels like to have amazing sex and to blow your mind. I will not stop trying till I’m sure you’ve had the full experience haha." 

If you’d asked me three years ago, let alone six months ago that this was ever possible… I would have never believed it. I’ve always wanted to have a girl who was really interested in sex (not to mention the complimentary drugs) and it really did seem like quite a far-fetched idea to me. 

With that said, I still don’t really know what we are. Are we just two people who have casual sex? Are we dating? Are we even friends? I think we’re just going to see where it takes us, because honestly, we both really have no idea.

The important thing is that I’m living in the moment and anything’s a possibility. So do we have a future together? I don’t see why not, but instead of creating an imaginary expectation in my head, let’s just see how things play out :)
