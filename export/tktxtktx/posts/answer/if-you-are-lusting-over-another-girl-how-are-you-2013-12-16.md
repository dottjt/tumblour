Question: If you are lusting over another girl how are you still writing apologies to your ex? Doesn't that show you don't care about that other girl as much as you think you do?

Answer: I wrote that apology to my ex because I really do care about her. I may not be intimate with her, however I still keep her in high regard. Not only as a person, but as someone who I consider a friend. She has such a wonderful personality and she really does mean the world to me, even if she’s currently in a bad place. I would never try to intentionally offend her, so that’s something I’m trying to rectify. With that said, I’ve also completely accepted the fact that I may never hear from her again and it’s something I’ve dealt with entirely. 

It’s good you ask this because I discovered something very important today. I realise that I derive a large portion of my self-worth from women and this idea of sex. The lust I generate from the presence of women, end up driving my emotions and I now realise how stupid that is. In realising this, I’m also trying to eliminate these beliefs from my life, by dissolving the false assumptions and agreements I’ve made in my mind. 

Don’t get me wrong. I really like this girl I’m talking to (and she knows it), however I want to focus on our personalities as opposed to the end outcome (I’ve talked to her about this and she understands where I’m coming from). I realise that sex shouldn’t be the end goal, because it’d just be doing myself a disservice. It’s good, because it means we don’t have to rush each other and we can just take things for what they are, since I’m not entirely consumed by her every frame in my thoughts. 

I need to realise there are other ways to value my life and that if I don’t fix these issues, I can end up having all the sex in the world, but it won’t make me feel any better as a person. I want to be that guy who reads books all day or writes novels. Anything that I can learn to appreciate out of excitement, not because it defines who I am. I think that’s a much healthier perception to live by. 

I’m also taking measures so that her lust won’t affect my everyday function, otherwise I’d really just be creating another Mimi and that’s obviously not very healthy for me. I mean, I’m the kind of guy who’ll hand-write you poetry everyday and make you cute gifs, however if I’m ever going to be properly intimate with another person; I’m going to have to learn to unconditionally love myself first. I want to focus on reading, writing, self-improvement etc. Women and sex have a place in my life, but they shouldn’t be the religion I worship. 

Though if you dress up as Cleopatra I may be inclined to bite ;)
