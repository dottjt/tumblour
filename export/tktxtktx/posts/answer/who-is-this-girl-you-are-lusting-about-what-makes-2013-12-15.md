Question: Who is this girl you are lusting about? What makes her so special?

Answer: Well, for starters, she already knows who she is and we’ve talked about having sex n’ all that, so I’m incredibly keen and excited. I actually met her on Tumblr a long while ago (on my previous blog) and I really liked her back then and I was incredibly jealous of her stories of sex n’ drugs, but she had a boyfriend so I was a little disappointed. However we remained friends and we’d just talk about life and relationships n’ all that and we became pen pals in that sense. 

Yet it’s kinda weird, because I never really had an attraction for her, up until recently when we started talking on kik. Even now, I guess I kinda consider her my crush. Her beauty. Her elegance. Her calm self-centredness. It makes me feel so out of place, yet it’s a privilege that engulfs me with feelings of lust and desire.

I write her erotica and she says the way I write excites her in ways that other men have never excited her before. She enjoys my intellectual depth and fervor. She finds me interesting and I think we both see a lot of potential in each other - potential we can’t quite describe. However it’s an overwhelming feeling we’ll learn to appreciate with time. 

In many ways, she’s nothing like me at all. Her writing doesn’t excite me and our personalities don’t seem to compliment each other, kinda like how Mimi and mine did. However that’s not to say we don’t have a lot of in common in terms of values and desires. We’re both really interested in sex and drugs and she really does have a very big heart inside her that I’m more than happy to explore. We talk to each other about ideas and concepts with a depth and honesty most girls lack. 

She asked me to describe her and this is what I said: 

“Calm. Collected. An air like innocence. You don’t feel the need to over compensate for your lack of better words and you display a control that gives me no leverage. You’re the definition of fair and proper, if ever words had been spoken. You seem placid, yet wired with imagination. You’re not particularly impressionable, however there’s a very genuine soul hidden in amongst the lack of pretense. You don’t convey yourself as particularly exciting or adventurous, though you know it’s because you have no need to sell yourself. You’re happy with who you are and it’s this quality of humbleness which society hides, yet truly desires. Most of all you’re articulate with intention: The prettiest citation of all.”

But by golly gosh, physically speaking she’s gorgeous. She sent me a selfie of herself in lingerie and honestly, I was just struck with awe; as if my mind had exploded into a million different pieces. She is stunningly pretty beyond words and I almost feel out of place with that sort of beauty haha. I adore her like a crazy. 

It’s also good for me, because it’s a girl who doesn’t have any significant mental issues; with her own insecurities, illnesses etc. I feel it’s good to get that perspective, since Mimi’s been implanted in my mind as “the standard” when really her experience was out of the ordinary. As Mimi said in her own words: “Love shouldn’t be a challenge.” 

I would find it difficult to describe our feelings as love and it’s odd, because our relationship is still rather confusing. It’s so incredibly undefined and it’s still early stages for the both of us, however we can both sense that we have something very special going on. The more we talk to each other, the more these feelings become apparent to us. I don’t think everything is glaringly obvious for the time being, however I think one day we’ll have that moment of sudden realisation and it’ll be pure bliss to say the least.
