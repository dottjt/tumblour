Question: could you be any more pretentious?

Answer: Put simply, these are words, and under further examination you may notice them dancing awkwardly to the tune I’ve displaced. Under no circumstance should they interfere with your perception of who I am as a person. I write, therefore I deceive. (oh dear, this dialogue is already dripping with pretense)

So yes. Obviously I’m desperate to get laid and am willing to sacrifice my sensibilities so that someone, anyone, is even remotely perturbed to approach me with their body and fuck me. Hey! You there with the jazz hands!? Please pick up your lazy gob and position it ever-so-slightly, into the desired position I crave. Any position, you hapless freak. Now dance. 

I apologise for wasting your time.
