Question: Maybe you shouldn't try so hard to 'find' a girlfriend. I think that's where you're doing it wrong. You aren't going to find love by treating it like hunt for prey. Perhaps stop trying to find a girlfriend and just try meeting people in real life and getting to know girls that way? Idk just a thought

Answer: Thanks for your advice, but I think you have to further understand where I’m coming from. Here’s the thing. People traditionally hang around other people from “similar” cultures (hence why you have themed clubs, goth, metal, mainstream etc.) and from there, you find partners that you like based on that culture. 

So therefore it’s paramount to understand that I am particular beyond belief. I have very little common value. In fact, I’m the kind of person who flat out rejects culture on all facets and adopts individuality as a philosophy. At my core, I would probably describe myself as a free thinker intellectual, which means I like to be everything and anything, yet nothing at the same time. I’m a blank canvas. A rag-doll.

My personality is that of the social manipulator. I’m the kind of guy who goes in and out of friend circles as that “hilarious yet unnecessary addition to the group”. It’s how I’ve always been, because in all my years, I’m yet to actually meet someone like me. Under no circumstance have I ever fit in. I’m an outcast by design. I mean, I’m not a bad person. It’s just who I am.

Even my closest friends are NOTHING like me. My best friend is literally the OPPOSITE to me, yet we get along so well. However these are my friends and I like them for what they offer to my life. Yet I feel it’s not the same with lovers, at least from my experience with finding “true love”. I need to love someone who is like me. At least that’s how my girlfriend made me feel and I had a tremendous amount of love for her. 

So where exactly do my “types” meet in real life? We don’t have an outlet. It would have to be by chance and considering who I am personally (introvert, outcast) there’s very little hope for me. The reason I like Tumblr is because it comprises of individuals and that is what I seek. 

There is no way in hell I would’ve found my prior girlfriend if it weren’t for Tumblr. We’re both the kind of people who like to stay at home. We don’t really go out to meet our “types” (since it’s physically impossible). The way I see it, Tumblr IS the meeting ground. There’s no way in hell we would have met in real life.

I just talk from experience. My ex was perfect, minus the illness obviously. Of all the girls I met in real life, not one of them have been in the same league. Like, literally, perfect. Everything I wanted from a girl and more.
