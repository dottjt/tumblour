Today is somewhat remarkable. I woke up with intention. There are two required elements for change: Awareness and will power. I have both of those things and it’s the most peaceful I’ve felt in a while.

Today I make changes to who I am. Today I learn about myself. Today I live in the present, not the false regrets of my past.

Personal freedom is a simple belief away. Conscious living happiness is a simple process which is not so difficult to obtain, however requires years of dedication and technique. I just need to study how I can change my beliefs into something more profound and I believe I have the tools to do so.
