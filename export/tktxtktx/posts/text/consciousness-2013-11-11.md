Your consciousness doesn’t make you unique. It doesn’t make you special. You are one of trillions of organisms with a mind of it’s own. I understand that yours is more complex, more powerful, more curious and possibly more functional than most, but any degree of arrogance pointing towards life’s intended “purpose” is but a delusion to sustain your own negativity towards nature.

You do not have wings to fly. You do not have gills to breathe. You are but a tool as nature intended. To exploit, render and harm. You know, nature always wins in the end. It exists and will exist far longer than you’ll ever be able to know. So don’t be so naive when disappointment knocks you out cold. Oh, it will eventually. 

Your consciousness doesn’t make you special. Just because you are the complete arbiter of your own perspective, feelings, emotions etc. doesn’t mean you have any more purpose than the humble clay you derive. Oh yes, you are but a derivative of the elements that contain you. Possession is an illusion which has served you well, though your spirit will care less once you die. 

You are a human and with no strings attached, even though you are compelled to compulse and pretend. Be relieved that you are a fond chemical reaction with nowhere to go but ‘constant’. You have no real choice in life. You serve to exist the space you preoccupy. It was given to you and will be taken from you, long before you’ll even have a chance to care. 

You are reality’s bitch. You have no control. You have no 'real’ innate desire or purpose. Yet in that tiny little brain of yours, relative to the vastness that is your intelligence, contains the very universe and all it’s meaning… plus more. 

Use it wisely.
