So here’s the thing. I love my girlfriend to pieces and I cannot even comprehend how amazing she actually is, even to this day. The only problem we have is that I can’t cum during sex. I don’t quite know why but sex with her simply doesn’t pleasure me, physically or psychologically. We kinda just do it and while I know how to really and I mean REALLY pleasure her, it all just feels like one, dull, simple motion. No passion. No excitement. I can get hard and at least appreciate it for what it is to an extent. But aside from that: Nothing.

After the 21st I was at last night, I ended up lying in bed with my psychology friend and we got chatting about it and I think I may know why. Initially I thought it was because she didn’t know how to tease me or seduce me and I think as a couple, the sexual tension between us is perhaps too fluid to be manipulated. I want her to control me in bed, to break me down, to make me her bitch. The only problem is that I’m very difficult to convince, simply because I’m the smooth talker myself. Though it’s important to understand that mind-games do work on me if done properly. However if you’re not that kind of person, then it’s probably not going to work out irregardless.

[Actually, on a side note, I think this may be why I want to have sex while tripping. I become so susceptible and vulnerable and with my emotions heightened, I basically become your little, stupid, play thing. I remember spilling water and thinking it was the most devastating thing on earth. I cried for a good 10 minutes.]

Anyway, my friend proceeded to touch my appendage and I must say, it felt relatively normal. I was completely comfortable with it and I could actually imagine him making me cum.

Then it hit me.

You have to understand that me and my psychology friend are both incredibly close beyond recognition and he’s a very extroverted person. There isn’t a moment where he doesn’t express himself to me and make me feel welcome. He’s truly the most amazing friend you could possibly have and you would place your life on the line for him, as he would yours.

I think the reason why my girlfriend can’t make me cum is because she doesn’t express herself to me. She very rarely tells me she loves me out of her own intuition and the worst thing is that whenever I tell her how much I love her or how much she means to me, she simply brushes me off and rejects any notion of my own expression. I cannot tell you how much it hurts and I can imagine a lot of it is subconscious.

That’s why I think the moment we have sex or try to be intimate, it doesn’t feel like I’m doing it with my girlfriend. Rather, she exists only as a concept in my head. Sex with her is like fucking any other body. She isn’t present in my mind. There’s no intimacy, because she lacks a psychological and hence physiological presence. I am passionate for her, but it is not her I am having sex with. I love her, yet what is it I’m actually loving? The notion of my girlfriend or the actual girl standing in front of me?

It’s not entirely her fault and I don’t blame for her woes. She legitimately loves me, but if I can’t feel her love and if she can’t say it to my face, then it really is pointless. She says she finds it weird due to recent circumstances, but that doesn’t make it right.

I don’t know. I could be completely wrong. I’m reading a ton of books into the subject and I feel I’m getting closer everyday.
