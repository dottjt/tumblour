I’m no longer going to commit to mimi anymore. That is to say, I’m 100% completely single at this point and it’s a nice feeling to have. In fact, if I were to cut her off completely from my life right now, it would make zero difference to who I am, how I function and what I serve to exist. 

I’ve been following this website for a short while and holy crap, what an amazing resource for anyone with personal issues. Anxiety, depression, mental illness. It just blows your mind as to how benign and dysfunctional ALL people are. 

If it’s one thing I’ve learnt from my first relationship, it’s that love shouldn’t be work for either party. It shouldn’t have to be “earned”. It shouldn’t feel like an obligation.

By all means, expose yourself to different people, but let the personality do the talking. Love isn’t something you work on. It’s something that’s instantaneous, unpredictable and fluid. The rest is delusion and control.

Even more importantly, people shouldn’t feel inadequate about themselves for not being in-love. You should already love yourself, first and foremost. Once you have obtained your own happiness, nothing else will truly matter. 

Love should be frictionless. It should be based upon the chemistry of two people, not the lust and false hopes of one. What me and mimi have is the complete opposite to frictionless love. It’s purely one-sided and I can no longer hold myself responsible to the way she feels. 

Contrary to the human psyche, happiness is a feeling that comes from within. Outsourcing the way you feel to the trigger of another person’s presence i.e. girlfriend, is a dangerous way to promote self-harm. It’s an amazing little experiment to play, but best kept in the lab where it can be contained. 

In fact, it’s made me realise how overrated being in a relationship is. The reason I initially pursued it so hard, was because it was something I had yet to experience and I was naturally desperate. However now that I’ve experienced literally everything you could possibly want for a relationship, and more, I no longer have those feelings. What happens in the end anyway, is that you place so much emphasis on the construct of the relationship itself, that you forget to gauge how you actually feel about yourself. 

Soon the false desires in your head dictate your life. Not smart. 

I tried to make it work. I really did. However in terms of life’s learning experiences, nothing comes quite close to dealing with a failed relationship. The worse, the better, and I’m glad it was an experience that happened early on in life, just because of the amount of perspective it’s given me on love and how a relationship should properly function. People told me to the move from the get-go, but I was willing to see where my struggle would take me. It’s referred to as “seeking opportunity” and now believe I have hit path’s end!

I would say the most crucial problem we have, is that she fails to communicate with me. There’s virtually zero meaningful communication between us. This seemingly works in her favor, because it means she can hide things from me and I can imagine that there’s a few other things she’s not willing to tell me.

I’m not going to stand for a lack of transparency. 

But I don’t know.

I don’t know how she feels. I don’t know how she feels about me. I don’t know anything. I am a dumb puppet; proud of my stupidity, blinded by my so-called love, which isn’t actually love, but rather my own sense of desperation and inexperience. I can’t remember the last time she’s actively seeked me in the past couple of weeks since she's got back. Chances are she doesn’t even care. Yet that doesn’t bother me, I’m already completely content with myself, with or without her. I have zero obstacles in moving forward. 

Of course, there’s the part of you that says she’s vulnerable and therefore in no state to communicate. This is where the guilt comes into play, because without communication, I have no basis to make any rational decisions on how I should proceed. I’m just a dumb, stupid puppet, stuck in my dumb, stupid puppet world. In fact, when I think about it, I see no reason why she can’t communicate with me. I just think she’s being dishonest at this stage.

So you’re ultimately stuck between guilt and regret. It’s like having Jesus not personally reply to your texts. Why doesn’t he care for me? I put so much into him; I read the bible, I pray before bed, yet here I am, the dumb bitch I was before. Yet guilt and regret are false constructions in your head. THEY DON’T ACTUALLY EXIST. That’s why I’m so willing to move past the red tape and get on with my life. 

Seriously: http://www.pathwaytohappiness.com/ 

That’s okay though. I don’t particularly want her anymore anyway. I mean, she’s an amazing person, but as she is, I see no point holding on to my own false desires.

Put it this way. By not giving me a choice, I’m going to have to make my own decisions. Simple as that.

I will not continue to second guess. I will not continue to serve a function I am no longer part of. If she wants me, then is at her own discretion, not that of my own. I cannot think for her anymore.

Breathe. Oh, it’s a refreshing feeling :)
