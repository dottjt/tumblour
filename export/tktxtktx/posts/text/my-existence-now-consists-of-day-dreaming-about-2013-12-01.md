My existence now consists of day dreaming about girls fabricated within my mind. Today I met Maximore, a character I may have conceived in the past. It was a typical date on the bank of a grassy hill and everything was perfect.

NOW I remember why I used to lucid dream so much in my teenage years. I got it down to the point that I could remember and control every single aspect. It’s just easier that way 

It’s not that you couldn’t meet these girls in real life (though it would be difficult). It’s not that I can’t flirt and I don’t have confidence. It’s just that all the good ones are already taken.

Fantasy it shall be.
