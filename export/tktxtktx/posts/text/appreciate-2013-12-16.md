I’m really happy. Yesterday was particularly good for me. I feel like I worked through a lot of my problems and that I’m positively progressing towards a heighten state of perpetual awareness; to who I am and the internal dialogue in my mind. I look forward to life. I really do. I look forward to waking up so I can have the opportunity to learn, read and be grateful for everything that my circumstance has provided.

It’s astonishing how my current attitude towards life is such a vast contrast to the person I was a month ago, if not one week ago. Yet when I think about it, very little has actually changed in my life. I’m still the same person I was before, with the same needs, the same desires etc. It’s like a light switched on in my head and the wiring has been configured to promote a culture of self-acceptance and self-respect. 

Of course, a lot of hard work went into making this reality. I made myself a commitment to be happy and that alone, speaks volumes about the person I aim to achieve. You don’t just “become” happy. It’s a concerted effort that requires time, knowledge and care. The best thing you can do today is make a commitment to your own happiness. Tell yourself right now, that you’re going to commit to being happy. You have that power. 

There was a lot of shit I had to reorganize and reinterpret in my head, but for a mindset of eternal peace of mind? Why the hell not.

Sure, I’m still going to grief when someone close to me passes away. I still may feel emotional pain. But by making this commitment, I’m eliminating 95% of that unnecessary bullshit which brings us down for no valid reason. I now have the tools to turn what would be months, if not years, of debilitating depression, into a few short few days/weeks. I’d like to think that’s worth spending the time on. 

I’m not entirely perfect. I’m not the Dalai lama by any means. However with my very real commitment, I work every single day to make my happiness a reality. That’s more than anyone can ask for.
