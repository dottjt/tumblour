Oh god, the whole process of finding another girlfriend is going to be such a bitch. I don’t know if I could invest all that time again. The flirting, the romance, the intimacy, the bonding, the caring. I mean, don’t get me wrong. It’s these things that I loved most about life. It’s just that the whole process is so arduous, especially in the beginning when you sift through all those people to try and find that right person.

I don’t know if I’m ready to do it all again, some 2 months after my previous one. It’s like being told your 500 page job application is invalid and that you’ll have to write it again. ugh.
