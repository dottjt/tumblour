It hurts to write about it, but it’s something I need to do for myself. It’s basic neuroscience. By connecting your raw emotions (the right side of your brain) to the logic/language side (left side) you can have a better grasp on the way you feel about your context.

I no longer know how I feel about my girlfriend. In the three-or-so months that we’ve been together, I’ve been madly in-love with her and I was under the impression that she was in-love with me as well. So in my mind it was the perfect fairy tale. Well, it turns out that she was never in-love with me, even though she continues to have a great amount of affection for the man that stands forth. On the surface, it’s a physical and emotional pain for me. But after a while it really eats into your ability to function.

The main issue for me is that she doesn’t express herself, possibly at all, because she has this kind of lethargic depression, where she just sits there in her sadness and it’s crushing to say the least. Even if I were to tell her how much I love her, how much she really means to my soul, she’ll just continue to sit there and shrug in her own insolence.

I don’t know if I can do it anymore. It didn’t used to be like this. She was loving, caring and romantic. Now she’s practically dead. 

Part of me won’t allow myself to turn my back on her. She’s going through a lot of pain, more than I could possibly imagine, and if I can at least provide her with a degree of relief, then the whole thing won’t be as hard on her. I need to remember that I love her for who she is and that will never change. Not a day goes by that I don’t think about her and when I’m without her, it makes me feel empty. A vicious, self-destroying cycle.

So really, I treat this as a challenge to myself. To give her up would be disastrous, but what choice does one have, when no choice is presented? Desperation. 

Yet if I could possibly express how badly I want my girlfriend back, I’d most likely implode into my own words. Her current state is worse than terrible. I can barely even call her my girlfriend at this point. I don’t know how long I can last. 

Deep down inside, I think she loves me, but her mental illness is such an inhibitor that it destroys any process of meaningful comprehension. Worst of all, it makes it impossible for me to love her. Though I can imagine she’d be devastated if I left her. Part of me is convinced that it’ll be indifferent due to the way she currently feels, though I think she’s in no place to be making any rational judgment. 

I don’t know what to do. I adore her so much. I think she’s the most amazing girl in the world, but every time I get close to her, it feels like I’m receiving a perpetual knife to the heart. I know it’s not healthy for me, but what choice do I have?

That’s love.
