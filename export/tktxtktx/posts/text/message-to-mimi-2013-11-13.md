Dear mimi,

What I have to say is crucial for the both of us. After you finish reading this post, I want you to stop reading my blog and I want you to unfollow me, as I will you. At this stage, I think it’s in our best interest to take some time apart. One week at the very least, though I may not even contact you after that period. You need to start making some own decisions in your life. Do you want me? Who are you as a person? How are you going to deal with your problems? That is entirely up to your discretion, not mine. It’s clear to me that you want to be alone and I serve no purpose to your recovery.

<!-- more -->

Of course, I will always be here for you if you truly need it. I can only exist as a friend in support and nothing more. I exist to understand you, be with you and make you feel human. I cannot be a form of attachment on any level, at least until you have recovered from your illness. Even though we’ve broken up (though really, were we ever in a relationship to speak of?) I still feel the same way about you. For me, it really was the relationship aspect which was killing me, not our friendship. Now that I’m not committed, I feel a sense of relief and freedom like never before. I am no longer depressed, no longer anxious, no longer in vain. 

I couldn’t deal with the soul destroying commitment that your depression brought me. The one-sided relationship on my behalf. Yet my dear mimi, you have not changed in my mind. Merely your position in time has shifted. You will always be my mimi and I will always be here to support you. With that said, at no point do I ever want you to feel ashamed of who you are. You are stunning, even if you may not realise it. 

You are my special girl and I will always be your precious boy. 

I just want to tell you, from the bottom of my heart, what an amazing girl you really are and have been to my life. You were my first true love; the most special girl in my heart. You were the perfect concept of a woman in my mind and there is nothing I would rather lust over, than your beautiful soul. Really, nothing more in the whole entire world. You were smart, pretty, pale, fair and most of all: heavenly. You honestly couldn’t have been more amazing if you tried. 

With you, I experienced all the emotions of going through a relationship for the very first time and I’m happy to say, it was the most magical experience I’ve ever had the pleasure to live. Certainly the most magical experience of my whole entire life. What I shared with you, the romance, the intimacy, the poetry, the prose, the flirt, the pictures, the sexting, our skype chats, your visit, the sex and your magnificent company. Most of all, our full realisation of each other’s chemistry. This all made me so incredibly happy.

Very few people have the pleasure to find someone who they truly adore out of choice, not friction. For that, I thank you more than I can possibly express. I would never trade in our experience for any amount of material wealth in world, even though our time was brief. It was imperfect on so many levels, but we made a commitment to each other. No one could possibly ask for more, in any relationship, under any circumstance. 

For the first time in my life, you made me feel complete. For the first time in my life, you made me feel successful. For the first time in my life, I actually could look at my life and be proud of what it’d become. You made me happy beyond words. In fact, I’d never experienced happiness on this level before, not until I’d met you. 

No matter what happens, I will always be glad to have had you in my life, because very few lovers get to experience what we had on any scale; from the sense of urgency we portrayed, to the attachment we laid forth. What we had was truly unique and I will always be grateful to have experienced each other’s passion. I will never forget you and you will always be the part of the me that I’ll never let go. You are my greatest achievement. You make me so proud and you should be proud of yourself as well.

However we cannot exist in our current form. It breaks my heart in so different many ways, but to continue our relationship in your current state is sheer madness. It wasn’t an easy decision for me to make and it still hurts me thinking about it. I put so much into our relationship. I gave it everything I could have possibly offered.

I gave up all my time, just to be with you and make you feel special. I put in all my effort, just so you could be the best version of yourself. All those poems I wrote you when I should’ve been paying attention in class; the hours I would spend thinking about you at work… literally everything. The flirt. The tease. My life. That’s why you mean so much to me and I why I wasn’t willing to give you up. I didn’t want to let you down.

I will never forget you for as long as I live. You will always have a place in my heart and I will take good care of your in my mind.

So please mimi, go be the girl the world would love, admire and cheirsh. Be the person you desire most. I am no longer an obstacle to your long task ahead. I have faith in you beyond these futile words. You’ll do just fine x

I love you so much and I’m crying as I write this, but now it’s your turn to shine. 

Love,

Julius xo
