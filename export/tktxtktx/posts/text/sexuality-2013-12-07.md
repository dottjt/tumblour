Like, I don’t know if you’ve read any books on seduction, but there are a number of seductive personalities that people appeal to and I happen fill a couple of those roles. Everyone inadvertently does to an extent. Shy girl fantasy etc.

Generally I’m the charmer; the romantic manipulator. I know what to say to push your buttons. I’m daring and willing to excite you to the point of danger. An asinine confidence with no bound. At the same time, I’m also gender ambiguous in my personality. So you know those nerdy guys who go crazy over chicks in cosplay? I have a similar effect on some girls, because I can be rather feminine. Understanding, caring etc.

On the other-hand, this also lends into the fact that I want to be treated like a girl. Pampered. Cherished. Forced. To be told I’m beautiful etc. When I truly think about it, I’m really just a chick inside a guy’s body.

A chick with enough testosterone to knock your face off. So please watch out as a flex my abdominal core.

So in essence, I live this fatal flaw where I want girls to approach me. I want my “knightess” in shining armor, to sweep me off my feet and into their castle of personal fortitude. From this view, I’m an incredibly odd combination. I want to be pampered, yet since I’m a guy, I’m forced to actually do the pampering.

That makes me the perfect lover in some senses. It means I can switch between the two and really play around with tease. More importantly, it gives the girl leverage to play around as well. Though really, it’s just about filling as many roles as you can and adapting to their vulnerabilities. Though now you know mine ^_^.
