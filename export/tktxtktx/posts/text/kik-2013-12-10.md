Life is just… seriously perfect. I’m so incredibly happy and grateful like you cannot imagine. 

I don’t think my life is perfect because I have everything I want and I’m living some kind of virtual utopia in my mind. No. Those ways of thinking are bound with fallacy and destruction. Life is perfect because I live in the present moment fully-aware of my existence and potential, unbounded by fears of critical self-judgment and negativity, on the subjects I call my own.

I feel my life is perfect because by living in the present, things can only get better into the future. 

Also if you have a kik, add me ^_^
