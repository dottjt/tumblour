Everything in my life feels empty and all I want to do is binge eat till my stomach hurts, and it already does and now I just want to cry at how pathetic my life has become :(

My friends are amazing, but they’re only temporary, and after they leave I slowly begin to realise how shit everything is again. I have no control. I had work all day and I was on the verge of tears the entire time. I’ve pretty much been eating myself to death since. 

You have the arrogance to think that you’re stronger than a bad break up, but you’re not, especially when it’s particularly bad. It’s not like I wanted to leave the girl of my dreams, but I had to for both our sakes.

Part of me wonders what she’s actually feeling, because she literally cannot physically express herself to me. She just says “I don’t know”, “okay” and “If you want” to literally every one of my questions. When I said we needed to break up, she said “If you want.”

So I can’t help but feel guilty for leaving her. What if she loved me, but simply couldn’t bring herself to do it because of her illness? We certainly had a strong level of attachment on so many different levels. I don’t know.

I’m just desperate, reckless and lonely at this stage.
