So I decided to try that idea where I hand a girl a really nice compliment I’ve written on a piece of paper. It was actually quite nerve racking, but you have to start somewhere and I’m glad I did it. My friend was initially going to do it cause I was so nervous, but I decided to do it in the end.

I was in the state library and I wrote “Your beauty is like fireworks to my heart x” in my own cursive and found this nice girl and I approached her as she was reading a book and she was really friendly when I approached her and I said I wanted to give her something. She was already smiling, because she knew she was being approached by another guy.

I put the paper on the table, smiled and then walked off. I had my friend there to gauge how she reacted and she was overwhelmed with joy. Apparently she was so incredibly happy and I can imagine that I made her day.

Eventually I want to leave my number on the paper and I really should have in this instance because I know she would have responded well, but I think it’s important to build up the confidence first and signify the meaning of what you’re doing which is really just me trying to be a nice guy, no strings attached :)
