I feel good today. I would rate my mood at a 7/10. I’m brimming with optimism and my head feels clearer than it did yesterday. I actually feel like I’m working towards something and my sorrow is a mere mist of what it was in the past.

I don’t know what it is, but I’m incredibly horny this morning. Like, all I can think about is sex. I’m not usually like this. I generally like women for the intimacy and sentiment, but today I just want to have casual sex all day as we watch daytime television. Even last night, I could barely sleep because I couldn’t stop thinking about different ways to approach women with my pen/paper idea. It’s such a great strategy because it’s so versatile, yet non-direct.

I’d be arrogant to assume that I’m far over my relationship woes. However a lot of the bad stuff is behind me and I’m starting to gain a sense of the person I was before. Yay!
