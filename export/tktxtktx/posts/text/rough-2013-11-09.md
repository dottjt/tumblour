Dripping from your thighs. Falling from your dress. These fingers are hungry for the lust that breathes within. You gasp to my hint. A shadow in your midst. I’m grabbing you violently, yet you murmur to the fabric; holding you deep inside.

You scream. You pull. You push. Your eyes in perpetual orgasm. I turn you around. Slap you. Punch you. To the ground you fall. I shove you; further. It hurts. You cry. You freeze. You’re mine.

Where are your friends now? Those useless creatures forever in vain. You poor little girl. These tears surround you, begging for mercy. Engulf you I must. What choice does a pretty girl like you have? Not a word to your name. 

Don’t appear so enticing dear. These teeth cannot taste your beauty.

Only your hurt.
