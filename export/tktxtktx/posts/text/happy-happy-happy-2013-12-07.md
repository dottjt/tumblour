Wow. Just like that. My mood is 100% back to normal, pre-relationship.

I feel happy. Like, actually happy. Why? I’ve figured out a way to get women, when previously no path lay before me.

I go to the city. I bring a pen and notepad. In their immediate, unsuspecting vision, I write a nice little piece of prose about the girl I’m lusting. I also leave my number on the back. I then hand the paper to them and walk away. The ball is in their court and holy mackerel, you complete genius, it’s almost too perfect of a plan!

You know, I think the problem wasn’t so much the bad break up, because there’s only so much mourning you can do it that regard. I think the problem was that I felt so helpless moving forward without her, that my only choice was to be miserable clinging onto the false hope we could be together. I wasn’t ready to let go, because I had absolutely nothing else to latch onto. I don’t know any girls, I don’t meet any girls; deary me.

So really, maybe it was my selfish desperation speaking all along, considering how difficult it was to find a girlfriend in the first place. I mean, I still love her generously, but now that I feel independent - I no longer feel that attachment and I no longer feel bad about myself.

I feel truly free and for once, everything actually makes a lot of sense now!

I mean, it’s possible that I still love her and that the mere thought is what is driving me to a higher place. Even if I don’t pursue it, just know that the helpline is there, means oh-so-much to me. Oh, who even cares at this stage! Happy, happy me!

Oh boy, I’m gonna sleep well tonight!
