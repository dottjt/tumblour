I’m very hi-risk when I think about it. I take hard drugs well over the standard dose. I hang around with gangsters and psychopaths. Most the people I associate with are interesting and dysfunctional. My family friends are all corrupt and filthily rich. The person I most to relate to is a sociopath and we both understand that we are two very exceptional human beings. I speculate my money on breaking trends and it makes me a lot of money. I expose myself entirely: That’s why I appear humble. It’s about feigning your own vulnerability. It gives other people a false sense of power over you.

I have a very genuine care for people. I go out of my way to make others happy. I don’t betray. I don’t cheat. I’m incredibly loyal and I understand the importance of trust. I love people, though not so much for who they are, but from what I can learn about them. Their behaviors. Their knowledge. Their culture. There are very few people I have the stomach to appreciate, however they’re in good hands once my respect is in their grasp.

I’m not particularly aggressive. I’m passive as hell. I have an immaculate sense of confidence. I don’t have second thoughts when I approach people. I understand where they’re coming from. I can read people and their intention, which is why I’m generally difficult to coerce with logic. My emotions need to be played with. I’m empathetic and compassionate, but I have difficulty accepting others. 

I’m very cunning. I know how to steal and lie to get to where I need to, but it’s just not who I am. I only observe and learn: I would never actually use it against people. That’s what differentiates me between myself and others. I’m not an actor, I’m merely a journalist. I’m the compel without the danger. There are very few people with my combination.

That is the cognitive dissonance I live with: Knowing that I could be so much more If I weren’t bound so strongly by my integrity. I find life easy. I treat everything as a game. I suppose that makes me a sociopath. I don’t think there’s one right way to play it. I just do what my heart tells me.

I don’t believe in morals, however I believe in being a good person. I wouldn’t call it a god complex of sorts. It’s closer to a superiority complex. Hopefully I have the talent to back it up.
