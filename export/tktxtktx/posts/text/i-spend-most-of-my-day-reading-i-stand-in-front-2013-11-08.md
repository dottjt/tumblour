I spend most of my day reading. I stand in front of my computer (yes, I’m one of THOSE guys) so I can absorb pages upon pages of finance/politics/philosophy. For variety, I then transition to lie on my bed with my phone loaded with eBooks in an attempt to learn something useful about my life, because that’s what I enjoy doing. Rinse and repeat. Let’s not forget the occasional bout of Pokemon to keep my mind from crumbling from all the information.

So if you can read really fast or if you really enjoy the way words tickle your fancy, I most likely want to stick my penis inside you.
