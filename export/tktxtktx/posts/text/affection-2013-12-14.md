I can’t stop lusting over this girl I’m talking to. She’s all I can really think about. My focus remains farce. She keeps flashing in my mind, like a benign childhood passion. I think it goes to show that I’m still dying for a woman’s affection in my mind. 

I don’t know why I’m so emotionally vulnerable. I feel like a rag-doll of emotional experiences, to be flung around and hurled. There’s such a large extent of female quality missing from my life, that I’m craving women in any capacity.

Yesterday was quite phenomenal for me. Ever since reading that website and applying their principles, I’ve just had revelation after revelation, strike me from all angles; torturing me like waves against the surface. 

In essence, Mimi was my religion. She was the god I worshiped. I felt that in her worship, she gave me love, acceptance and compassion. I felt that she allowed me to be the best version of myself and it was only through her, that I could feel alive.

Of course, Mimi was just an image in my mind that I built out of my own desperation and lack of affection. I built Mimi as the image of god in my mind, because it provided me to the answers of my own emotional suffering. I painted Mimi as the perfect girlfriend in my mind. I was 100% convinced that she was infallible in every single way, even though the reality did not pertain. 

So imagine coming to the realisation that your god isn’t what you think it is. You instantly spur yourself into denial. You don’t believe the “lies” because they don’t fit the description of reality in your mind. You end up fighting against yourself to protect the god in your heart, because it consists of your entirely belief system and more. 

You put all your faith into that one entity. That’s why the process of recovery is so difficult. It’s about reclaiming what little of yourself remains, having outsourced your entire sense of self-worth to another person.

With that said, I feel I’ve sorted a lot of that out in my mind and also feel comfortable with how it makes me feel. However in the back of my mind, Mimi’s influence still lingers like a scar on my perception. Part of me still sees her as the perfect being and it’s incredibly difficult to let go. Because in-spite of her depression, I really did love her personality. She was similar to me in so many ways, that was difficult not to become attached.

She really was what Mao represented to the cultural revolution. I’m sure you can come to your own conclusions. 

I still really do care about her and I wish her the very best in her own recovery. I don’t think she’s a bad person. I think we’re both incredibly unfortunate and in pain. Maybe one day we will be friends again. It’s something I look forward to. Yet what made it so difficult is that there were so many questions left answered. Did she really like me? Was it her depression? Is there anything she’s hiding from me? How much denial was she in herself?

One thing humans don’t realise is that it’s so easy to entrust themselves in others, that they forget they’re the ones who created the false perception in their mind in the first place. They forget that they created these images in their mind and that they have just as much power to destroy them. The problem is that once you start to believe in something so strongly, it completely distorts your ability to perceive and even take action. 

Mimi is still a feint reflection in my mind and while I still don’t completely feel detached, I understand the importance of emotional stability in my life. Oh, it’s still rather confusing for me.

Life isn’t fair. That’s what I’m trying to rectify.
