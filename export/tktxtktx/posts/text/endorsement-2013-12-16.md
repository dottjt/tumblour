People are really dumb creatures. Don’t worry, I was one of them. In many ways I still am. There’s a reason why society has problems, in-spite of all these so-called “solutions”. People never actually stop to critically think about what may be causing their emotional pain, only the “glamorous” images we’ve been sold for a better hope. 

That’s okay. Our denial is entirely subconscious and supported by our own beliefs. You know, those things we’ve put all our faith in, irregardless of what they represent? Personally I was under such strong denial that it should have taken me many more months before coming to some sort of break through.

I guess it just goes to show how flawed conventional wisdom is. 

I’m going to make a very bold claim that may angry some people, perhaps in reflection on their own struggle. I don’t think anything is too difficult if you have the right technique and mindset. Of course, therein lies the problem: getting there. 

I can’t stand it when people glorify celebrities for “taking the fight against depression." I mean, this sort of endorsement has been going on for decades and yet depression is worse in today’s society than it ever has been. Let me explain the basis of why. 

When you’re depressed (let’s assume this isn’t an overwhelming chemical issue in the brain, and relating more to a crappy childhood or perhaps a bad break up) what happens is that you create a negative self-image of yourself. That is the source of your depression: the attitude your mind has conjured for whatever reason. You think you’re worthless. You think you’re hopeless. You victimise yourself. You feel paralyzed with sadness. Everything hurts and you have no idea why. Mood issues? Duh. 

So enter Mr. celebrity and they decide that the best way to approach a negative self-image is to create a stronger, positive self-image to combat the negative one. Oh yes, let’s cherish the world with "positive energy” and everything will be just fine. 

This doesn’t work for a number of reasons. Firstly, the person with the negative self-image is still stuck in the point of view of that image. Just like how an anorexic believes they’re not the correct weight, telling them that there’s nothing wrong with them and that they’re beautiful, does absolutely nothing to shift their point of view. 

In fact, it makes things worse because since they’re stuck in that point of view, everything else outside of that view feels disingenuous. They sense that what they’re hearing is a lie and it further reinforces the negativity in their mind.

What you ultimately need to do to change the way you feel about yourself, is to change your core beliefs, shift your point of view and dissolve the images in your mind. 

The solution isn’t our ego and “what we think of ourselves”. No. They’re the issue. The problem are these positive/negative images in our head and the belief systems supporting them. We create so many false assumptions, so many false agreements that create emotional pain, we become completely blind to what’s causing our woes. Yet this is the emotional base we’ve created and so we only see our issues through this paradigm.

At the end of the day, there’s nothing wrong with you. Let’s make that clear. Like a computer with a virus, there’s nothing wrong with your hardware (again, assuming this isn’t overwhelmingly genetic or caused by major physical changes in the brain). You were happy before and you can be happy again. What you need to do create an emotional base that doesn’t rely on these “images” to determine your self-worth. You are not those images. They only exist in your mind. They must be dissolved and the only way to do that is through self-awareness, of how you interpret these false assumptions and agreements in your head in the first place. 

This is the easy part. Once you have self-awareness of these assumptions (this is the skill you’ll need to develop, therein the hard part), all your flawed beliefs will fall apart quite easily because of how silly they’ll seem once they become apparent to you. After all, these are false assumptions and agreements you’ve made in your mind. They only exist because of the faith you’ve put in them, not because they were ever substantial. If you're not skeptical about the way you feel, naturally you're going to be vulnerable to your own negativity. 

What makes it so difficult is the process of challenging your own sets of beliefs. Naturally your mind is going to fight back against changes to the status quo. You can be depressed for 20 years and overnight, you can alleviate these issues if you just take the right approach. It’s not a miracle. It’s certainly not witchcraft. It’s ignored psychology.

Most people never get to that point. Instead, they struggle indefinitely with their lives and they let it define them. It’s a terrible thing, but it’s a fact of life. Change requires two things: will power and technique. The very idea that a person can change, should be evidence enough that there are greener pastures around the corner. At the end of the day, emotions are generated from within and everyone has the power to change. The only thing stopping you is your own intuition. 

It’s easy for people to get angry when you tell them “you have the power to change” because they’re still stuck in the victimisation mindset. It’s a lot simpler for people to stick to their beliefs, because that’s what gives them comfort. It’s what gives them power. Yet they don’t realise that they have an even greater power inside of them. Hence denial. 

If you want to deal with these sorts of issues, you need to completely dissolve the images in your head, along with the false beliefs and assumptions that they derive. Because at the end of the day, you’re none of the images in your head. They’re prefabricated to for “emotional safety” hide your true self. 

Though really, these are all ideas and concepts that I’ve taken from this website:

http://www.pathwaytohappiness.com/

It has all the tools and techniques to help you become self-aware and dissolve the images in your mind. It was a lifesaver. 

If it weren’t for this website, I honestly don’t know where I’d be. I’d probably still be depressed and stuck in that realm of emotional denial. My break up was particularly difficult for a number of reasons, but I’d compare it to losing your faith. I built her up as the perfect god and so to imagine losing that, I’m sure you can understand what I went through. 

Now I’m happy with myself. I’m just happy.
