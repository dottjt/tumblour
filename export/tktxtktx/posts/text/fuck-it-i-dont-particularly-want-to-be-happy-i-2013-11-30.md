Fuck it. I don’t particularly want to be happy. I know I can, but I really don’t see the point at this stage.

I’m going to eat crap. I’m going to lie in bed and play video games. Guess what? It’s going to make zero fucking difference to my life.

Everyone’s fucking retarded and I’m expected to have standards? Not today my friend. I can’t have anything. Nothing I do ever makes a difference. I’m a worthless piece of shit so I’m going to start acting like one.

I really would just like to meet someone who can actually get their shit together, so then I won’t feel like I’m the only one without a problem. I’m sick of loving. I will not love.
