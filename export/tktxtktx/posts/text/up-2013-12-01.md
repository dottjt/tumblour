Alright Julius.

Let’s get back to reality. You can do it. Well duh, of course you can. You can do just about anything. You may be in denial about the false images in your head and you may like to romanticise your own victimisation, however this isn’t what life wants of you. 

Life isn’t fair. I’m trying my hardest to deny it and playing along with the self-depreciation is what gives you comfort, but it really isn’t the way any rational person would prescribe their own sanity. Sure. I will always be vulnerable and desperate, but there’s nothing wrong in being a little crazy. All my friends are crazy and delinquent. It’s what gives us character.

So let’s go to the bank and deposit that $400. It’s time to study the course and make some money. Women aren’t going to make me happy… but fuck it. You know having a girlfriend would be pretty swell. But I neglect one simple aspect to this all.

I make an amazing boyfriend. It’d be pretty swell if they had me as-well. I have no reason to be angry at others. That’s just the desperation speaking.

I am not worthless. I am just unfortunate… and you know what? I can live with that.
