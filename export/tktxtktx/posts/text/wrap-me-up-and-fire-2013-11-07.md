I don’t feel shame. Occasionally I’ll try and mask my feelings with my over-eagerness, but it really doesn’t make any sense to me. There’s a fine line between being confident and brazen, though hardly relevant when one laughs without price. It takes a strong heart to be in-construed by the people around you, but a stupid soul to destroy it. 

Today is a different flavor. I can taste it as an odd yellow. I’m generally obliged to reveal myself… but fuck it. I am who I am. It is what garbage represents to the American process of sustainability. I don’t run right. I taunt like the scar of my sensibilities and I cry to the palm of my hands, because these tears are my sodden enemy. You can neglect your own senses until that little blue rock turns red in the sky, but until you garner enough of your own pain to force courage into those receptors above your consciousness, I really see no point at this hour.

I’m relatively simple. I may be human at times. Feeling is not as objective as it may seem. Perhaps I want your touch. Though who am I to deserve fine things.
