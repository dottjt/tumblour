I really feel I have no need for tumblr anymore. No need to express a false sense of myself. No need to sell an image. No need to prove myself to others. No need to pamper my insecurities.

All these things which were driven by my fear, hate and negativity for life. I’m just really happy with who I am and all I really want to do is express my love to those who mean the most to me. 

I’m happy to learn, to read, to do all the things I love and become the version of myself that I best see fit. 

…and I didn’t need religion to do it ;)
