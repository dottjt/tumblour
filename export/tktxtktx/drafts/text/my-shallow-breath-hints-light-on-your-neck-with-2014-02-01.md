My shallow breath hints light on your neck. With a vivid insolence, it speaks silence of your mind. It corrupts you with imagery of sex and violence. It penetrates you helplessly; rape wandering delinquient through my penitentiary of sick perversion. It persperates and whimpers on the pores of your grace; seeds planting glory to my mellow built tone. 

It molests you with a fine anticipation, as my hands grip vice around your weak exterior. Your body covulses and twerks into twitch; too stupid to realise my brutal potential; now let free to run amok inside you. 

You tinker out to a cute squeal, yet you reek with vulnerable emotion; if only to feel loved and cherished. I retaliate against your sanctuary with an even greater sense of scar, like an attack on your divine purity. You shriek and collapse to the floor; clasping desperately to my unbuttoned shirt. 

Passed out silly on your knees, gripping suitably between excitement and fear. You stare at your god; the alien of your sexual desire. I take off my pants and your eyes widen to glory.

Yet you’ve far from proved yourself worthy.

You bite your lip as a sign of respect to the brash eagerness of my hands. They strike you from all directions; blinding you with a constant barrage of ruptured sexual tension. You’re drowning in a sea of my perpetual lust, as you gasp at my overwhelming destruction. Barely can you think straight, let alone possess thought at all. Down your pants. Inside your dress. On your breasts. Scratching deep along your thighs; screaming maniac to my void of misconception. 

Collapse you are again.

You’re dying to please, yet you can only conceive my images of lust in your mind. You point at me innocently with those puppy dog eyes, yet I reject you adamantly like an unwanted child in fervour. You beg and I ignore. Then you light up in euphoria; struck lunatic by the deep sense of fear I’ve instilled into your eyes. I grab you and choke hold. You uncomfortably smile.

I pull my cock out; shoving it deep inside your throat. You instantly give in. For that temporary moment of bliss you feel wanted. You feel care. I’m everything you want plus the images and more. Like caressing a lollipop, you gorge on your sweets. You assure every crevass with the talent of your sugar deprevived tongue. You’re lonely and whore.

I shove your head in deeper; your throat beginning to choke. It brings up images of hope and self-loathing. I’m the comic book in your mind, one fucking chapter at a time.

I take out my penis. You immediately collapse. You’re done. You’re proud.
