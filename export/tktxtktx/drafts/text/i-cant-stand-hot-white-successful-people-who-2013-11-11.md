I can’t stand hot, white, successful people who try and give advise to their less attractive, less successful peer. Humans are a product of their environment, not a direct result of other people’s empathy. I think it’s particularly arrogant to suggest otherwise for the ‘betterment’ of humanity. 

I mean, we all have our own desires. I personally have this vague desire to be hot, white, tall and muscular. It’s never going to happen and it’s certainly not one of those things I obsess over, but it’d certainly be nice. I mean, fuck. It’d certainly make me feel better about myself. 

People often say that you should be “proud of who you are”, which I think is somewhat bullshit. Don’t get me wrong, I am proud of who I am, but I those who struggle are those without perspective. Without truly understanding who and what you are, really defeats the purpose

I have a small dick. Listen, I’m not complaining. I’m not obsessing over the fact that it’s not that big. Sure, it’s not visible, but I’m not good looking either. But still, it is what it is. You can point it out, you can ridicule it, you can say what you want. The important thing is that I’m not insecure about it. 

So if you’re ugly or your fat or you have some sort of aspect about yourself that you’re insecure about it, don’t try and be so offended. Because your emotions are what they are: negative. Do you really see any point in basking in negativity, even if you cannot help it? Is it really the best way to live anyone’s life?

There’s so much about me that is constantly examined and judged, but so what? Trust me, I’ve been there and I’m out of ordinary. I say things that have significant consequences to the way people perceive you. To have a group of people who you think you know, hammer you incessantly for the next half hour about who you are sucks, but it’s not something to feel negative about it. It’s certainly not easy, but you gain nothing from hiding yourself. 

Strength needs to come from within. It needs to come from your words. It needs to come from your determination. If you can sort yourself out, it’s
