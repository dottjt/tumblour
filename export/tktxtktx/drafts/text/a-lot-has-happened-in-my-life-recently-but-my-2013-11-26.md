A lot has happened in my life recently, but my will to write is entering it’s 4th stage of premature “heat” death and resurrection is an unlikely possibility at this stage. So let’s dot point this bastard and soak up the blood as it oozes on the floor. Let’s squeeze that fucker dry. 

- I’ve been working towards “fixing myself” with a website dedicated to happiness psychology and holy shit, it’s literally changed my life. It’s important to understand first and foremost that everyone is fucked up BIG TIME. The problem is that it’s entirely subconscious, so most people never find out. It’s the kind of thing that you’d wish you’d read 10 years ago, because you wouldn’t have gone through all the heartache over the years. It’s funny, because at work, I can now instantly pinpoint everyone’s problems from a mile away. Trust me. EVERYONE has significant issues and they don’t even realise it. The sad thing is that these problems, such as jealousy, depression, being judgmental etc. are very easy to solve. It’s just that they’re so benign that 99.9% of people don’t realise they have a problem until their life becomes so unbearable that the pain of suffering becomes greater than pain of changing. That’s the predominant problem: People think change is difficult, but the problem is that they change the wrong things and they wonder why they’re back at square one and worse. I could literally write another 10,000 words about this. 

- A have a new hobby: Trading cryptocurrencies. I’ve always been a bit obsessed with.

- Even though I have purpose in my life, my existence feels ultimately empty. It lacks the excitement and passion I had when I was in a relationship. She WAS my life and now that the attachment is gone, I’ve managed to patch up all the holes, but it’s not the same. I just want to love another human being.
