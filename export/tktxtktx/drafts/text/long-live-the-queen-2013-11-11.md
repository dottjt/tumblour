If you’re a socialist, it’s probably in your best interest to kill yourself before the disease plagues your brain and gives you cancer. If you’re a capitalist, I like your style, but you’re living in an unrealistic utopia which doesn’t exist. You if you’re a fascist, well done! You’ve just described the vast majority of nation-states! Though realistically, we all want to be at the top of the hierarchy. It’s all that’d suitably matter, if given the opportunity. No, it may not be offered to you. You are already tainted. You must be born into royalty to see it suffice. Also know as the systemic oligarchy, which people are too blind to appreciate. Money, money, money. 

Oh yes, red vs blue. Hilarity ensues. Key word: Opportunity.

Humans act out of self-interest. As a person, you can only relate to the experience you see fit, so why bother empathising with others? Yeah, yeah, I understand. It feels good to help others, but if we didn’t derive a sense of satisfaction from it in some way or another, you would most likely be on suicide watch. I know it feels good to help disadvantaged people and I personally lend a helping hand whenever I can, but any that claim it makes you’re morally superior, is a sham in your own mind. Nice n’ all, but who ran off with all the money!?

Try and solve exponential growth in any meaningful way to what humans have presented; I’ll give you a lift to the mental asylum once you’re done. Mathematics you whore. 

Yet it’s not something to be condemned, nor feared. There’s a reason why the world exists in it’s current state. There’s a reason why things don’t change: they only fluctuate. YOU have to understand that OUR understanding of the world has stayed the same, because humans themselves have not changed in the slightest. We are no more smarter than our ancestors, simply more knowledgeable. Do I see you picking up the book of benefit? Oh, shame on you!

When we see things through a blurred lens and reality doesn’t match our perception, it somehow makes us even more deluded from the ‘cause’. 

Understand and you will change. I’m not a hateful person. People don’t offend me. I step back and try and empathise with their cause, even if it goes against everything I believe. Until you understand that we’re all just a bunch of humans who have been conditioned to feel a certain way from learned behaviors, life doesn’t seem so threatening anymore.
