There’s a strong sense within me that says I’m never going to get another girlfriend. Yet when I think about it more deeply, I realise that in order for me to find a girlfriend, I would have to be crazy in-love with them. Meaning she would have to be my own personal definition of perfect. 

I just don’t see it happening.
