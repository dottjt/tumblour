I think probably the thing that I liked most about my ex-girlfriend was that aside from her personality - the kind of personality that made me think “Wow, I’ve never actually met a girl who has my same sort of attitude” - She even looked like the kind of person I would date. If I ever had to conceive what my girlfriend would actually look like if I didn’t have one, she would be it. 

We look a lot the same, or at least have a lot of the same facial features. Same kind of nose. We both look a little bizarre, but certainly not unattractive, so I’d say we’re both at equal attractiveness. From the way we talk, to just about everything I can think of. We just naturally attract each other.

I think that at some point, I’m going to like/hate every single personality type. At one point we will have hated each other, then at some point we would have become friends, purely based on the context alone. I like variety, yet you can’t have variety in a relationship. She needs to be like you in order to make it work. I think that’s what makes me so sad.
