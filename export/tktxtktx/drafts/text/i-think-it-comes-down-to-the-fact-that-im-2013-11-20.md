I think it comes down to the fact that I’m naturally attracted to dysfunctional people, guys and girls. Almost all my friends are dysfunctional, which is why we almost always drift apart in the end. Yet they’re exciting. They’re interesting. They’re smart. They’re bourgeois. After many years of this unhealthy addiction, I think I’m beginning to realise how unhealthy it really is. On the one hand, I don’t judge them for who they are. On the other, they’re inherently different and I forget that simple fact. 

Though put it this way: Everyone is dysfunctional, yet most are in denial. At least the dysfunctional are honest about who they are.
