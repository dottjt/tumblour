I just have to be that guy who turns things from bad to worse. Deary me. 

I mean, gee. You never express yourself to me. You don’t tell me anything. You really don’t seem to care. So how on earth am I supposed to know how to respond? As far as I know, I’m just trying to do my best.

Communication, you know. Clearly not.
