I sometimes wonder if I’d be happier if I had a heap of bitches and got laid every weekend, but then I realise I’m just not that kind of person.

I don’t even really know what I get from women to be quite honest. I think I like the change in personality. You don’t have to be so

I think that’s one of the most difficult things growing up is: Dealing with societies standards. We’re told that we should make lots of money and that hot women are good and all these things that supposedly will make us happy. Yet if you’re not that kind of person, you pursue your own integrity and you think that you’re a failure. 

I don’t particularly believe in equality, however I do believe in respect and everyone has something to admire.
