I feel lost. I don’t really know how I feel about women anymore. I think I place so much emphasis on this idea of sexual desire, that it begins to ravage your thoughts and everything just breaks down into a heaping pile of autonomous mess. 

I don’t really know what I get from sex. To be quite honest, I don’t know why I even care about it that much. It’s like I’ve been conditioned to crave something that has no real basis in my life. It’s like it’s something I have absolutely no control over, because my hormone are just telling me to fuck. 

Even then, I feel like sex is something I haven’t properly explored and so that’s probably the internal dialogue speaking in the back of my mind.
