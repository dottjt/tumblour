When I think about it, I really didn’t have any sufficient way to deal with life prior having a girlfriend. I was constantly frantic. 

Having a girlfriend, really was the perfect compliment to my life. In fact, it was my life to a large extent. I find it incredibly difficult to develop a passion for anything else. Though I guess it’s a lot easier to love another human, than say, an ultimate hobby. 

I really do think love ruins you as a person. I think that’s why my mother made my life so abstinent of women. Man, I hated my upbringing.
