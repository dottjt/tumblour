I’m actually glad I broke up with my girlfriend, because it helped expose my own flaws as a person and how I can better myself.

My emotions of jealousy, hate and disdain are something that I accepted, but never sought to fix. Now I realise that they are unnatural and I’m going to try and reverse these things.
