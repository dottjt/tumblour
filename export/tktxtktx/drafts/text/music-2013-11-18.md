So, I have the worst music tastes.

- The Friday Night Boys.

- Envy On The Coast.

- Sing It Loud. 

- The Bigger Lights.

- The Maine.

- The Starting Line.

- Artist Vs Poet.

- Cute Is What We Aim For. 

- The Scene Aesthetic. 

- Mercy Mercedes.

- Forever The Sickest Kids.

- Breathe Electric.

- Valencia. 

Chances are, you probably haven’t heard of these bands before. Be grateful. You probably had a normal childhood where you a) weren’t sexually frustrated and b) didn’t feel inadequate about yourself.
