I have a lot of different friend groups, all of which I adore and for different reasons or rather, add to the ‘variety’ that is life. A large portion of them are the 'drug-induced’ crowd whom I’ve progressive drifted away from, as I’ve slowly entranced the merits of being sober (though I’ll chow down on a good psychedelic any day of the week). Then there are the plethora of 15/16-year-olds whom I used to hang out with earlier in the year, as a requirement to fulfill those lost “teenage years” I’d never had the chance to grasp i.e. asian upbringing. Then there are the spate of friends from high school, whom I love deeply but are also plagued by severe depression and denial (lesson: don’t send your kids to a single-sex, academically elitist high school). Though my current crowd consists of the kinds who like to drink, camp, beach, hike, mashed in with some good ol’ family values. Lovely, lovely people. 

Though I cruise a lot in-between groups and I find it really easily to make new friends and transition, since I basically know as that “hilarious guy who makes inappropriate comments” which is why I’m so disposable, yet interchangeable. One thing I can promise, is that one year from now, I’ll be friends with a completely different set of people and my life will be barely recognisable. 

So I’m really happy with my life and the only thing I would criticize thus far, are the friends who are casual and open about sex. Everyone seems so frigid when it comes to sex and due to my background of sexual deprivation… I honestly want it more than anything else.
