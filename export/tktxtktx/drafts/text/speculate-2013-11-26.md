So yeah, I’m officially a speculator now. I’ve always wanted to be a speculator, but I’d never had the funds and to be quite frank, the markets scared the shit out of me. To a large extent they still do, but ever since the arrival of bitcoin I now have 100% confidence in the future. 

The basic paradigm currently is that the U.S. empire is about to collapse and I mean that in a very big way. Contrary to popular belief the U.S. economy has been absolutely gutted and the people are REALLY struggling. It’s not like here in Australia. We’re EXTREMELY LUCKY so we really don’t know what the rest of the world is going through.

The decline of the U.S. really is corollary to the global financial system, which is paramount to any sort of stability. Of course, I say “stability” when really I mean “hanging on a thin string” which is why I’ve been in a panic since 2011. 

However, come 2013 and bitcoin has taken off and finally I can take a breather. Treasuries are LOL worthy at this stage. Stocks are hilariously overvalued by various standard deviations and will collapse into a heaping pile of mess, perhaps by January (also signifying the end of the U.S.) and those worthless fucking dollars you keep in the bank are… worthless fucking dollars. 

Enter bitcoin.

Ah yes, a decentralised currency with the fervor to create paradigm. Let’s play, shall we?

But after a few years of confidence, I’m absolutely killing it. Let’s just say that I’ve nearly doubled my money since last Friday and I’m applying for a personal loan to put more money into the mix.

At the very least I expect to make 300% of what I put in. This is just the beginning ^_^

Trading and speculating was always going to be the natural outcome for me. I mean, I’m not exactly predisposed to gambling, but it’s hardly gambling when you trade on paradigm.

It really did start with the information for me. I became obsessed with finance after my mother put me in charge of the family finances and I even did a youtube channel and podcast on the subject. I would wake up every morning to do the finance/comedy bulletin
