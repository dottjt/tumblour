If you don’t want to hate yourself, don’t send your kids to an academically elitist, selective state high school. I would say that’s what fucked me up the most. It made me hate everyone, Everything.

I’m smart, but I’m smart in… a different way. It’s not academic, it’s more a social awareness that gives me the ability to percieve. That’s what it is. I have heightened perception. I think it’s a skill. But basically, it’s a psychological process. I read people’s faces, I can kind of tell how a person is, whether they’re smart, dumb etc.
