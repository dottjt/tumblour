I don’t really know how I feel about sex anymore. I’ve had sex a handful of times, with two different girls (I only lost my virginity this August) and it’s left a rather dry taste in my mouth. At no point has sex actually made me orgasm and I find the whole ordeal rather taxing. 

I figure I’m one of those guys who needs to really, REALLY love someone and have them love me equally as much, before I can equate any real value to the act of sex. 

and I don’t think it’s left a very good impression on me.
