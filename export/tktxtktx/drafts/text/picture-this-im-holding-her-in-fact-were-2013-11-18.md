Picture this: I’m holding her. In fact, we’re holding each other in the very bed we slept in. We’re lying there, motionless to the time around us. I can feel the warmth of her skin. Her life is a sign of love. Yet even though I can feel the comfort of her hair, brushing against my stupid face, I realise that I’ll never be close enough to my mimi. My insecurity is all that I can grasp. 

What more does one need to say?
