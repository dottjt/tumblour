So a few things happened yesterday. 

Let me tell you, what I achieved yesterday in terms of my own mental wellbeing was phenomenal. The time tripping was used to contemplate and reflect on the all the aspects of in my life, ranging from my emotions to my relationships.

What I achieved in those few short hours was more than what hundreds of sessions in therapy would ever contemplate. I talked about mimi to such a vast extent that it makes me completely comfortable with her, the situation and myself. I talked about awareness, the idea of image, how people perceive each other and all that jazz. 

I’ve come to realise that mimi was my religion. She was the god I’d constructed in my mind.
