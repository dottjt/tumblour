Clearly I’m WAY too harsh on myself. I’m incredibly critical of who I am, yet I very rarely take the time to praise myself. So for the sake of my own sanity, I want to say that I’m incredibly proud of who I am as a person. I’m happy enough with who I am, that I’m willing to sacrifice my own “face” so that I can further myself and work towards becoming a better person.

In fact, everyone should be proud of themselves. I take it upon yourself to feel that way. My entire Tumblr, seems to be an expose into how much of a dysfunctional jellybean I am, even though it could be farther from the truth. 

- I don’t take any medication and never have. I have no significant mental illnesses, disorders, physical health problems etc. None of that. 

- I’m an incredibly fit individual. I eat super healthy and I’m in great physical shape.

- I have an amazing network of friends. Never in my life would I ever think that I would have to actually choose between friends, but it’s legitimately at that stage.

- I’m generally well liked. I’m friendly and I’m compassion. I don’t look down upon people and I don’t judge people for who they are.
