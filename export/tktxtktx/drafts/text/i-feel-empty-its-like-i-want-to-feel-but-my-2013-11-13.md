I feel empty. It’s like I want to feel, but my body is physically unable to produce any sufficient emotion. I have no direction. I feel like I’m suspended in mid-air, unable to move to any degree. It’s like my life wants to breathe, yet it has no requirement to do so. It wants to see colors where there is nothing to visually grasp. My body is an empty hull. 

I’m a little disappointed, because I thought I was going to be doing weed today, but my friend said he was too sad and distraught. Guess what his problem is? He has an indecent obsession with plastic surgery, because he thinks he’s ugly. He has a disease of the mind, but that’s his problem.
