I couldn’t even tell you how depressed I feel. I’m so empty I can barely feel myself. On the other-hand, I’m angry at everything because life clearly hates me and it most likely doesn’t want me to have even the most basic of privileges anymore. I just want to curl up into a ball and disintegrate back into the earth. I’d rather gather dust in a tiny little shed for the rest of my life than have to put up with my every living moment. 

I want my girlfriend back. I want her more than anything else in the world, but I can’t have her. 

You have moments when you think you’re better than a bad break-up. You think you’re stronger than the symptoms that surround you. But I’m only human. I’m fragile and delicate. I just want to be held. I just want to cry. 

Maybe it wouldn’t be like this if it wasn’t long distance. At least I’d be able to hold her. At least I could have some sort of connection to keep me going. Just to see her face. But I’m defeat.

If I could just figure out a way to turn my brain off without killing myself. 

I’ve been comfort eating, getting stoned, anything that helps deal with the void.
