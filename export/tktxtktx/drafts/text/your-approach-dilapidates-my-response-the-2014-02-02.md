Your approach dilapidates my response; the confidence I cannot obtain. Your each and every stride towards my tremble, sends my mind one step closer towards sexual anarchy. I’m vulnerable and shaking; your vicious smile hawking back with a sinister collective. The forebode in your presence shackles my autonomy into a false sense of independence. There is no liberty to my thought, only the delinquient entrapment of your violent word. You brush your hair aside into the projectory of my face and there’s not a single thing I dare do about it. My internal shame is too great; basked heavy in the helplessness you indoctrinate.

Another slave for your pretend; the firm grapple you rein upon my unworthy soul. It eats away at my sensibilities, like the derelict of an animal turned mad. I try to relieve you from my mind, however my perversion is wholly instilled within the suggestion of your intrigue. The glance in your dare puts my heart into a coma. You simplify my self-worth down to the mean demeanor of your stare; the choke of my stupidity to your shine. Those accumulative eyes hunt me down to a fatal cower; killing me ever so slowly like the victim you intend to fuck. I gulp to your glare, glancing away like a scared child in uncertainty. Please don’t hurt me. I didn’t mean to do anything wrong.

You stand there at the tip of my heels; placing your finger in my mouth like a piece of decorative furniture; the inanimate object you wish to discard. You slap me for giving in, entrenching your knee into my stomach for my misbehaviour. I tense and shelter. Nothing is mine. Not my body; not my thoughts. Not even the sensation you provide. I’m just a peon to your command; your subject to be conditioned and sold. I’m your black market good; the secret no one ever has to know. You are the scam that selectively eats from my pool of frail emotions; your stupid little game to rig and manipulate.

You bend down and expose your cleavage to my face. All I can do is stare. The choice was never mine.

The tight latex of your fine shroud embodies my vision. Your bust shouts danger from afar, as if pressed against the affection I never had. The curvacious snap of your body brings my thoughts into an articulate climax. My hands fish desperately for your perky nipples; the protruding flesh you calibrate to my despair. You waterfall your chest onto my face, like filiments of heaven smacking down onto my reality; my hands yet to experience the taste of your skin. I want inside you, but you refrain my senses from their pleasure. The anticipation is worse than death. I bite my lip to the delirious tune of the girl who teases yet does not allow. I want you. I need you. Oh please. Let me caress you. I’ll do anything. Take me. You must. Please. 

You slowly make your way to my pants, jerking my penis out with a fervent desire; completely disregarding the way I feel. You disassemble the thoughts in my mind; the protection from your evil. I’m just another helpless fool for you to fuck; a catalogue of the suffering you wish to inflict.

You grab me by the jaw, shoving your breasts into my face once more. It hurts to think of my suffering. I can barely breathe. I’m gasping for the air around me, as the sweat from your sweet luscious drips down onto the hard exterior of my stomach. Your soft goodness jingles ever so lightly to my feint deliberence. I’m suffering in heaven. I love you eternally but my body needs function. I must breathe. 

You do not wait.

I return to consciousness and you start fucking me like your naive play thing. I lay there with my hands tied to the bed, squirming and pulling as you laugh in my face. I feel dumb; insensate with no where to run. No escape to my name. I struggle under your weight; your body mashing inbetween my desire and your lust.

Oh please, kiss me. I want to feel your lips against mine more than anything in the whole entire world. You disregard my request, barely notice the struggle of my conception, only the glory of dominance in your eyes. You continue to fuck me as I squirm in my own little world of hurt. My emotions begin to form tears, as your abuse spreads to my mind. You see my visible pain and you doubt your motive. You reassure me with your kind words. 

“Please don’t be scared, pretty thing. I didn’t mean to bite. I promise baby.” 

You place your loving hands on my face and you blow me a kiss; the boundless longing in my heart. Smiling with my ego in chance, I look up into your beauty, but you slap me hard again.

“I’m sorry.”
