I think my problem is that I romanticize every single aspect of being in a relationship. I don’t see things clearly. I’m too blinded by own ability to want anything bellow the standard that is being in-love. Then once I’m in-love, everything thereafter becomes irrelevant and it wouldn’t matter if I were depressed, cheated on, spat on or even lied to. It wouldn’t make a difference, because I would simply be reassured by being in the relationship itself. 

How very Stockholm syndrome of me. I think the obvious reason is that even though I’m a pretty “wired” guy and I have the perception of intelligence to match my stature, I’m just a sucker for romance.

The reason why I didn’t bother to try and find a girlfriend up until this year, was because I honestly thought there were no possible good ones around. I was under the impression that they were all downright terrible. But what happened, was that I realised the only thing I hadn’t really done in my life thus far, was be in a loving relationship. So I set out, to much frustration, eventually ending up with mimi.
