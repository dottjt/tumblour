So you want to know the truth? Well, I think 99% are really “dumb”. Though dumb is too much of a generalisation and barely communicates what I’m actually trying to say. Listen, I think humans are intelligent creatures, but that’s not what I’m refering to. What I’m really point at, is the capacity for humans to be self-aware. Well, not exactly.
