So today I had go to the bank to approve my $10,000 loan. I’m basically going to be using this money to speculate on the markets. Oh yes, please call me crazy. I do believe I smashed in a glass door because I was tripping that hard on acid and even though people were trying to help me, when really I thought they were trying to kidnap me into a conceptual void of intellect. 

I’ve really developed a passion for trading. I find the whole thing incredibly exciting. There are so many different aspects to it. For starters you’re gambling your money, which means you can either lose it or make it. However I’d like to think that with the right strategies, you can always end up making money.
