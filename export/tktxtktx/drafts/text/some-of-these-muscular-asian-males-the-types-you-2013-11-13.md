Some of these muscular Asian males, the types you see at asian clubs, absolutely scare the fuck out of me. I’m the kind of guy who reads faces and I do so quite well, but some these guys have faces like sharks. I mean, some of them are the nicest guys, but at the back of my mind, I can’t help but feel that 

That’s the one thing I absolutely hate about club Asians. They’re about as dumb as seaweed and worst still, they take everything you say for face value. So if I were to make a wisecrack (fuck, all I do is make wisecracks) I can’t help but think I’m going to get my head pummeled in.
