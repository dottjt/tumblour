I write these hilariously brash messages to girls over Tumblr, generally describing some sort of overt sexual fantasy that generally transcends the social norm over the fine tastes our society have descended too.

I mean, it’s great erotica, it’s just that people are too placid in their thoughts. They are scared and I do not blame them.

I think people have the wrong attitude. We take things for face value, for what is really just the poetry in your head. What I’m really interested in, is how you flirt and respond to what’s given in front of you. I want to see your intellect at play, not your agenda. Are you malleable or are you taut?

Creativity is a lost talent that begs for your attention. Without an open mind, progress cannot be extended beyond your own bias. Process with akimbo.
