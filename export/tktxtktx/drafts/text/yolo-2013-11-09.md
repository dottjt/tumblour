He didn’t understand, the process of wonder, how minds would work, when prodded and ruptured; torn and spread. He lived like fire, but he never sought to fill the mis-requirement for his own, sinking demeanor: forever eating away at the heart which never gave. Shaking and with grief, he sat diligently at the helm of his desk, provoking the thoughts of his own immediation. The kind of sentiment that gathered own lonely thoughts into packets of three. One for you, one for him and the rest construed. Lost in nature.

He was a sophist at heart, though a pain in the you-know-what. His conception was his own. His heart vile and content. Yet even as the perfect premonition to his own disguise, our young valiant solider was neither friend nor foe. He fought his own battles with his own sorrow. 

It wasn’t until much later, that he discovered he would be dead. Loosely hanging from a perch up above. Available to a discrete world of stars and signs: the very existence he longed to breathe. If five was a number, he’d still be young again. Comprehension to infinity.
