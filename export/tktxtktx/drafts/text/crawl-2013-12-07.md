This is good. I’m definitely getting somewhere. I’ve reverted back to my standing desk and I’m starting to slowly cut down on my carb intake and back into a paleo diet. I actually have the audacity to read and learn, which is really just saying that I have focus on getting back to where I need to be; fixing my problems. My bedroom is clean. I’m slowly beginning to exercise and tonight I plan on going to bed early, so I can wake up and do it all again with greater focus and awareness. My hand is also getting better.

*hi-five!*

I’m not quite there yet. Perhaps not at all. But I’m crawling towards my target and I know I’ll get there in due time. I want to learn speed reading again and begin this other program, but there’s no point running into this Rambo style without grounding myself first. Otherwise I’ll just be back to where I started. Remain calm, collected and most of all, humble. I’m not superman, but I can at least resemble the best version of myself.

Yet in-spite of all this, I know one day I’ll find a girl who can fully appreciate me for who I am and I’ll break down into tears just thinking about it. That isn’t the focus, but I’m getting a little teary just thinking about it. No dramas.
