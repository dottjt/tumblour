My girlfriend would most certainly have to be an intellectual.

I think there’s a misconception as to what an intellectual is. Though let’s just put it this way: Of all the people I know who are significantly smarter than me, I would only consider a handful of them intellectuals.

Even worse, is that I want an intellectual without culture, which is a big ask within itself. I just want a girl who can challenge me mentally. Someone who can out flirt me and banter about things with more than one dimension.

“I just want a hot bitch with a brain.”
