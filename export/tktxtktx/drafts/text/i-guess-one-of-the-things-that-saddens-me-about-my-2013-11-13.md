I guess one of the things that saddens me about my girlfriend’s departure, is the fact that we didn’t really get to explore sex that much. I mean, it was inevitable by the fact that it was long distance. But I still would have loved to explored her sexually.

She came over for 4 days and it was nothing but sex and touching. I loved every moment of it. The biggest problem with my life, is that I’m yet to go through any sort of “sex phase”. I’ve been through a drug phase, but I want to have so much sex in so many different ways that I can go home and say: “Well, I no longer need to have sex to feel adequate about myself." 

My life has mostly been sex/women deprived. Simply by design. I can talk to women with 100% confidence, I don’t come accross as weird, I can be funny, flirty, cute etc. It’s just the opportunity. I generally just don’t find many girls worth chatting to.
