I find it hilarious when I see tall, white, Caucasian guys complain about their problems. Fuck you. If I were tall, white and Caucasian, I wouldn’t have any problems. Do you know how much easier it is to approach people without being judged? Already, you have the leverage in the conversation. Already, you’re desired by the other party.

Instead, I have to dress glamorous and fancy so I can grab their attention.

But you know what? Fair enough. The upshot is that I’ve had to learn to smooth talk. The hard part is getting in, but once I’m there, I kill.
