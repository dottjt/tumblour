I have very little issues with confidence. There’s nothing about people that particularly scare me, because I generally can read people and gauge their weakness or vulnerability, so I can exploit it and get them to talk.

However I’m very much the curious type. I’ll risk a potential new friendship by taking things down a very weird path 

Maybe I’m manipulative, but it really is just an internal desire. 

Everything you do is subconscious and you can get a person.

But at the same time, it’s not like I try and intentionally just get people to fuck me. I’m really just not that kind of guy. I mean, obviously I’m frank and straight forward as it is, but I’m not a bad guy. You see, the people who are really easy to manipulate are really dumb.

It’s the people I can be genuine with and not coerce, are the ones I’m interested. At that point we’re on an even playing field and everything we do just becomes flirting.

It’s called having fun and it’s mutual.

I think I come across as threatening and untrustworthy because my theories may be foreign to you and you doubt their practicality. However I assure you that it works perfectly in practice. I’m sure capitalism sounded radical the first time around. “Wait, people own things!? Like, other people?”
