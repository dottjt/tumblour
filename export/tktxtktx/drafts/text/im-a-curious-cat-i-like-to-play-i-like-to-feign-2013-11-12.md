I’m a curious cat. I like to play. I like to feign my death to relief of that mouse, so I can pounce at the sucker for a second time. Yet I do not want to kill it. I must torture the poor thing till it’s conditioned to fear my resilience as something superior. I must teach it. I must destroy it, so that it can be reborn as something more… apathetic? Apathy is the essence of power. Confidence is the skill I must instill. That mouse must be my fellow cat

The rather useless introduction aside, the only thing I’m truly curious about is the truth. I will do anything to get closer to the truth, even if it possibly kills me. I’m a journalist, what did you honestly expect. 

I have these reoccurring dreams where I live this completely lifestyle of luxury and glamour. Diamond necklaces. Purple Lamborghini’s. An Italian backdrop with thousands of pretty women, serving the lifestyle I will never portray. Which is odd, because I’m a relatively simple guy. I’m an intellectual: I love my emotions and my brain. Yet I realised I have these dreams because I want to make my girlfriend happy. I already bask her in my love, but I want to treat her really well. I want to buy her amazing things and bathe her in everything she’s ever wanted. 

I was in this particular version where I was in the streets of China and a bunch of thugs began feeling me out of nowhere. I knew those bastards were after my money, so I began beating them, but it did nothing. I was punching them, striking them with my knee, yet it was like they were cloth rag-dolls with no sense of humanity. So they managed to overwhelm me and they took my things. However this charming, suave butler came to the rescue and beat them up and got me back my stuff.

He was this tall, handsome, white person with a perfectly athletic build, dressed in black suit and white gloves. 

I could never cheat on my girlfriend.
