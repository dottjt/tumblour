I couldn’t possibly imagine what mimi is currently going through. Let’s leave it at that.

Under no illusion do I feel I’m qualified to talk about depression, however it’s an illness I’ve had on and off experience with, so I can at least contest to how I’ve grappled the beast with my own two eyes. So please, dear reader. I beg you to take what I say with a grain of salt. 

I can imagine that everyone goes through the same emotions when experiencing depression. All experiences in life are really come down to our emotions. Happiness. Sadness. Anger. We’re all just chemical reactions at the end of the day, to varying degrees. 

Sometimes when you’re depressed, perhaps to the point of being bed-ridden, you become so empty that the surging pain from your chest becomes your only comfort. When you feel nothing at all, pain acts as a relief. It becomes a solemn reminder you’re still alive. Yet personally for me, I don’t think it’s your feelings that are ultimately relevant. After all, emotions are universal yet not everyone has depression. 

I think the defining factor of depression, is how it’s dealt with. This relates more importantly to personality. People with depression shouldn’t feel ashamed of who they are. Do not rely on a false images in your head telling you that you’re “not good enough”. They do not exist, only as a construct in your head. (note: http://www.pathwaytohappiness.com/writings-insecurity.htm wonderful link)

Part of the problem with treating depression (and arguably any other illness) is that there are so many different diagnostics and treatments, that chances are, you’re going to end up wasting A LOT of time simply relying on other people to fix your problems. Everyone is different (hence personality) and there is no one-size-fits-all cure. If you do not take the initiative to do your own research, I guarantee that you’ll be spending YEARS on what could potentially be mere months, or even weeks. It is 100% crucial you do your own research. 

I cannot emphasize this enough.

Everything at it’s core is technique. I believe that if you have the proper technique and mindset, you can fix ALL of your problems. Now don’t get me wrong. I’m not saying that depression is easy. Instead, I’m saying that based upon personality, it’s easier for some people than others. The same goes for weight-loss. The solution is actually rather simple, yet people still struggle with losing weight. It’s not that the techniques are flawed, it’s the person’s inability to prescribe to technique: hence personality.

Thankfully I have a couple of traits that help me get through depression extremely well. 

- I understand what has to be done. I have the knowledge to combat depression. As a journalist-type figure, my specialty is that I know a) which information is useful and b) how to get through it quickly. 

- I have an extremely low tolerance to degradation. This ultimately comes down to being self-aware. At a certain point in grief, I acknowledge that this is not healthy and that I must change. 

I’m still human. I still go through the same stages that everyone does. I certainly don’t find it easy in the slightest. I’ll lie in bed all day and feel like absolute poop. I’ll binge eating myself to death and I’ll cry just thinking about how pathetic my life has become. The difference is in how I deal with it. 

Here’s the other thing that people with depression need to understand: recovery is incredibly accessible. By accessible, I mean that all the solutions are already there. No really. You can become the person you want to be, I would say within a few weeks, if you chose the right plan.

Now, as I said, if your personality isn’t in the right place, then these solutions will mean nothing to you. I’m going to make a suggestion, again, grain of salt, and say that depression isn’t greater than your personality. HOWEVER, personality isn’t everything. A lot of the time, it comes down to simple luck. I would say that it was like that for me in the beginning, but not so much now that I’m much wiser. 

What people with depression really need, is an opportunity for change. What I mean, is that they need some kind of event to rock their life and give them different perspective. I would say it’s largely impossible for perspective to come from within (when in this state), which is why it’s best to receive from external sources. The two instances in my case, was my mother getting a boyfriend and subsequently, when an old friend had introduced me to his group of mates. 

The longest I ever went, was probably 2 months and honestly if it weren’t for my mother’s boyfriend, I don’t know what I would’ve done. So even if you don’t have that specific personality, it’s not something to get hung up over. You’re not perfect. I’m not perfect. We are simply human. 

That’s why it’s important to maintain friendships while depressed and not reject them, because these are people who can support you. More importantly, they can provide you with change and hence perspective. I mean, I never told my family for the same reasons that most people don’t, however everything you can do to maximize these external 

I remember that period being particularly difficult for me. I’d basically lost all my real-life friends, I’d had a falling out with my “regular best friend” and I’d just voluntarily stopped talking to my one amazing friend over the internet, simply so I could pursue my media interests. I was lonely. I was depressed and I was hopeless. All I did was write poetry all day. In fact, it’s all I wanted to do. 

I would wake up in a haze of depression and emptiness. With an expressionless face, I would drape myself over my keyboard and type a bunch of poems and articles. I remember not even having any strength within my fingers to type. I was that lethargic. 

I think that’s why I’m so open with people now. Some people think “Oh gee, it’s going to be awkward as fuck if I tell them about etc.” but if you don’t have this relationship, then when things do hit the shit, you’re going to find yourself in a position by yourself and that’s when you’re most dangerous. 

I was severely depressed just one week ago, to the point of not caring about anything, at all. Everything was pain. Yet here I am, fully recovered and even enthusiastic about life. Thankfully I have experience with depression, so I know what to do to combat it.

Again, take what I’m saying with a grain of salt. I can only relate to my own experience and I don’t want to convey the wrong message. I’m simply telling you what I went through. 

I don’t blame mimi. Sometimes it makes me sad to see her the way she is, but it’s this kind of perspective that makes me realise that I’ve gone through the same thing as well.
